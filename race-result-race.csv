From the outside barrier, KING ON EARTH was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
K C Leung (MASSIVE) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near 1100 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of CALIFORNIA ROCK which was taken in onto SPARKLING SWORD, resulting in those horses being unnecessarily crowded for room and causing SPARKLING SWORD to lose its rightful running approaching the 1000 Metres.  In this incident, MONEY CAFE was steadied away from the heels of SPARKLING SWORD near the 1100 Metres and AMERICAN FAME became unbalanced when bumped by SPARKLING SWORD near the 1000 Metres.  K C Leung was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 9 October 2014 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Wednesday, 1 October 2014.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SPARKLING SWORD, Z Purton stated that after bumping MONEY CAFE shortly after the start, SPARKLING SWORD became unbalanced and was inclined to race keenly.  He said after being crowded for room for some distance approaching the 1000 Metres, SPARKLING SWORD did not travel comfortably at any stage thereafter and he was obliged to ride the horse along in an endeavour to maintain its position.  He added after being placed under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn, SPARKLING SWORD was particularly disappointing in the manner in which it did not respond to his riding and gave ground noticeably over the latter stages of the race.  A veterinary inspection of SPARKLING SWORD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SPARKLING SWORD, a favourite for todayâs race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SPARKLING SWORD will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Throughout the race, SMART VOLATILITY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, A Suborics stated that, from an outside barrier, he was asked to ride HELENE SPIRIT in about a midfield position if possible.  He said this was due to the fact that HELENE SPIRIT was racing over 1200 Metres and also for the fact that todayâs race was expected to be run at a fast tempo.  He said shortly after the start he commenced to shift HELENE SPIRIT across behind runners, however, at the same time LORD SINCLAIR, which was drawn inside HELENE SPIRIT, was also steadied by its rider and for this reason HELENE SPIRIT was obliged to race further back in the field than had been hoped.

Near the 200 Metres, MEGA CHAMPION was awkwardly placed when attempting a run between BEST TANGO and WHY NOT.
Over the concluding stages, SUPREME FLIGHT raced in restricted room between OVETT and KING OF REASON.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that it had been intended for PRINCIPAL to be ridden in about 4th or 5th position if possible, just behind the speed.  He said PRINCIPAL began only fairly and then, despite being ridden along in the early stages, did not show early speed and consequently got back much further than had been intended.  He said he then continued to ride the horse along, however, PRINCIPAL did not respond and was not able to improve its position.  He added when the tempo of the race slackened in the middle stages, he was obliged to race on the rail inside runners and for this reason he had to ride the horse for luck in the Straight as he was prevented from shifting to the outside of runners.  He said he was initially able to improve his position in the early part of the Straight, however, PRINCIPAL was then unable to obtain clear running over about the final 150 Metres and because of this was not able to be fully tested.
PRINCIPAL, JAZZY FEELING and SMART BALL were sent for sampling.

In the early part of the Straight, HIT A HOME RUN was held up for clear running when awkwardly placed close to the heels of MARK TWO.
For some distance after the 300 Metres, VARA PEARL had difficulty obtaining clear running and then when attempting to improve between HIT A HOME RUN and GRAND HARBOUR made contact with HIT A HOME RUN on several occasions.
When questioned, K Teetan stated that he had been asked to ensure that he obtained cover on GRAND HARBOUR.  He said he was further asked not to ride the horse along in the early stages but it was felt that GRAND HARBOUR would have sufficient natural speed to obtain a handy position and it was hoped that the horse would be able to follow HIDDEN VALUE which connections believed would be a strong chance in todayâs race.  He said after GRAND HARBOUR began well, he shifted across to race outside HIDDEN VALUE, however, DEMOKLES was being aggressively ridden to the inside of GRAND HARBOUR.  He said he believed if he continued to race outside HIDDEN VALUE, GRAND HARBOUR would be left racing wide and without cover which was contrary to his instructions.  He said he therefore elected to steady GRAND HARBOUR and obtain cover which he was able to do behind VARA PEARL after the 1000 Metres.  He said he was comfortable in this position as GRAND HARBOUR was travelling well and he had been able to obtain cover as requested.  He added however that approaching the 700 Metres GRAND HARBOUR was taken wider by HIT A HOME RUN which shifted out and this resulted in GRAND HARBOUR being taken into a four wide position without cover.  He said he therefore elected to allow GRAND HARBOUR to stride forward rather than being taken wider still.  He said in the Straight GRAND HARBOUR hung in and proved difficult to ride but was still able to finish off the race.

The performance of NONE OTHER, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, NONE OTHER will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding his riding of NONE OTHER, Apprentice K C Ng stated that he had been asked to ride NONE OTHER in a forward position and lead if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount vigorously out of the barriers in an endeavour to be as forward as possible.  He said RACING HERO, which was drawn inside NONE OTHER, showed more early speed than his mount and he attempted to ride NONE OTHER to obtain a position outside that horse.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion FLYING UNICORN, which was racing to the inside of NONE OTHER, was vigorously ridden to improve its position and therefore passing the 1400 Metres NONE OTHER was left racing in a position three wide and without cover.  He said he felt the tempo of the race in the early stages was good.  He added after allowing NONE OTHER to be balanced rounding the turn near the 1100 Metres, he had a look to his inside to ascertain whether it would be possible to shift NONE OTHER in behind FLYING UNICORN to obtain cover behind that horse.  He said however that SMILING WATCH was positioned directly behind FLYING UNICORN and for this reason he was not able to obtain cover behind FLYING UNICORN.  He said rather than remain racing three wide and without cover, he therefore elected to ride his mount forward to see whether he would be able to cross FLYING UNICORN.  He said however that FLYING UNICORN maintained its position between RACING HERO and NONE OTHER and as such he was not able to cross that horse.  He added whilst he was aware that the tempo of the race was quick at that time, he felt that that was a better option rather than remaining in a three wide position without cover.  He said in hindsight he considered that it would have been better had he remained racing outside FLYING UNICORN rather than continuing on in an endeavour to clear that runner.  Mr A S Cruz, the trainer of NONE OTHER and allocated trainer of Apprentice Ng, confirmed that he had asked Apprentice Ng to ride the horse positively in tonightâs race.  Apprentice Ng was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he had erred in attempting to press forward on NONE OTHER after the 1100 Metres given the tempo of the race.  Apprentice Ng was reprimanded and advised that whilst he is still an apprentice jockey, he is a senior apprentice and as such he would be expected to ride his mounts with sufficient judgement so as to give them every opportunity to finish off their races.
Z Purton (RACING HERO) pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct under Rule 155(5) in that in the vicinity of the Weighing Room following the race, he directed an inappropriate comment to Stipendiary Steward E C Kwok.  Having regard to Jockey Purtonâs prior record of charges under this Rule, the Stewards were of the opinion that, given the circumstances, the appropriate penalty was for him to be fined the sum of $25,000.
A veterinary inspection of RACING HERO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of RACING HERO, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, RACING HERO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

A Suborics (ROMAN LEGEND) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that approaching the 900 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of PURE FORCE, causing that horse to be hampered and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  WINNING KING, which was racing to the outside of PURE FORCE, was inconvenienced in this incident.  A Suborics was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 13 October 2014 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 5 October 2014.

Approaching the 700 Metres, MARVEL TRIBE was momentarily steadied away from the heels of DISCIPLES TWELVE.
Near the 150 Metres, WINFULL PATROL and DISCIPLES TWELVE (C Y Ho) made contact due to both horses shifting a minimal amount of ground.  When this occurred, DISCIPLES TWELVE became unbalanced and shifted in, resulting in WINFULL PATROL being crowded for room between DISCIPLES TWELVE and HARBOUR PUNK which became unbalanced after being bumped by WINFULL PATROL.  GENEROUS BOBO, which was following and was attempting to improve into running between HARBOUR PUNK and ROMAN LEGEND where there was insufficient room, was hampered when HARBOUR PUNK shifted out after being bumped by WINFULL PATROL and in doing so made contact with ROMAN LEGEND which was also hampered.  C Y Ho was advised that whilst DISCIPLES TWELVE had not shifted far and made initial contact with WINFULL PATROL, nonetheless in similar circumstances he must make every endeavour to relieve tightening when his mounts shift ground.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on ROMAN LEGEND at the request of Trainer A S Cruz.  The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, ROMAN LEGEND will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Throughout the race, CLEVER BEAVER travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding his riding of KIROV in the Home Straight, C Y Ho stated that as his mount was obliged to race at the rear of the field due to being crowded for room at the start, he was subjected to a significant amount of kickback which adversely affected his vision, particularly in the middle and latter stages of the race.  He said he was able to establish, shortly after entering the Straight, that there was a run directly in front of KIROV, however, he was also aware that a horse was shifting in towards the rail and therefore he elected to shift to that horseâs outside.  He said near the 150 Metres he wiped the visor he was using in an attempt to clear his vision, however, he was not able to do so to the degree where he was able to fully establish where his mount was in relation to other horses in the race.  He added nonetheless he rode KIROV out as best as he was able under the circumstances, however, his riding of the horse was impacted upon by a lack of vision.  Having viewed the videos, the Stewards accepted that, particularly in the early part of the Straight, there was a significant amount of kickback apparent on Jockey Hoâs visor and that this had a bearing over the manner in which he was able to ride the horse.  However, the Stewards formed the view that after the 100 Metres he was in a position to ride KIROV more vigorously than he had given that he had partially cleared the kickback from his visor.  C Y Ho was advised that his riding out of KIROV over the latter stages of the race had come under notice and he was further advised that in future he must avail himself of all necessary measures to ensure that he is able to properly test his mounts.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of AMBITIOUS KING, J Moreira stated that although his mount was able to obtain the lead without having to be made use of in the early stages, AMBITIOUS KING travelled too keenly throughout the race and because of this was not able to finish off its race.  A veterinary inspection of AMBITIOUS KING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Throughout the race, UNIQUE HAPPIEST travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, D Whyte stated that he had not been given any specific instructions on where to position MAC ROW other than to obtain cover if at all possible.  He said the circumstances of the race in the early stages resulted in him having to ride MAC ROW behind midfield in an endeavour to obtain a position with cover behind COLOURFUL PROFIT.  He said after obtaining this position passing the 1000 Metres, MAC ROW was then taken wider on the first turn and this resulted in it having to travel four wide and often without cover after the 900 Metres.  He added the circumstances of the race and tempo of the event, in his opinion, resulted in MAC ROW not being able to close off the race.  A veterinary inspection of MAC ROW immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said when he did this, he was unaware that ULTIMATE GLORY had lay out rounding the turn which presented a tight run between that horse and EXCEL ONESELF.  He said when he committed to shift to the outside of ULTIMATE GLORY, FUJIAN SPIRIT did not quicken as he had hoped and because of this he was not able to improve between ALL TIMES LUCKY and UNIQUE JOYFUL, resulting in FUJIAN SPIRIT being held up for clear running for some distance after the 150 Metres.  He added whist ULTIMATE GLORY lay out in the early part of the Straight, that horse then shifted back in towards EXCEL ONESELF passing the 350 Metres before shifting out further after the 300 Metres.

When questioned regarding his riding of HARBOUR DELIGHT in the early and middle stages, Apprentice C Y Lui stated that he had been instructed to lead on the horse with the blinkers applied.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode HARBOUR DELIGHT vigorously in the early stages to take up a forward position.  He said near the 1400 Metres HARBOUR DELIGHT shifted ground abruptly and unexpectedly which resulted in him having to straighten the horse to prevent it from shifting in further.  He said as he had ridden HARBOUR DELIGHT on two occasions previously, he was aware that the horse has a soft mouth and was mindful of this when shifting HARBOUR DELIGHT towards the rail in the lead.  He added although he was aware that HARBOUR DELIGHT had opened up a margin over the remainder of the field, he was reluctant to restrain the horse more heavily as he did not want it becoming unbalanced and getting its head in the air.  He said notwithstanding this he attempted to steady the tempo on HARBOUR DELIGHT as he was aware that the race was being run at a fast tempo.  Apprentice Lui conceded after viewing the video he should have made a greater effort to restrain HARBOUR DELIGHT given the significant margin that the horse had established over the remainder of the field and the tempo of the race at that time.  Trainer D Cruz confirmed that he had asked Apprentice Lui to lead on the horse as it had blinkers applied and he felt that the race would be run at a slow tempo as, in his opinion, there was a lack of horses that had previously led in their races.  He said whilst it was apparent that HARBOUR DELIGHT was travelling strongly along the Back Straight, in his opinion, Apprentice Lui could have done more to attempt to steady the tempo at this time of the race.  Apprentice Lui was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that HARBOUR DELIGHT did race keenly along the Back Straight, nonetheless as a 7 lb claiming apprentice jockey who has ridden in Hong Kong for some period of time now, he would be expected to show far greater effort to steady HARBOUR DELIGHT than he did on this occasion.  He was further advised that he must make every endeavour to rate his mounts so that they are able to race competitively.

Also shortly after the start, ISLAND SPRING was bumped by DELIGHT FORTUNE which shifted out after being bumped by CALIFORNIA ROCK.
At the 500 Metres, COSMO ONE was bumped by ISLAND SPRING which shifted in.
CALIFORNIA ROCK hung in badly throughout the race and for some distance between the 400 Metres and the 300 Metres made contact with MIGHTY GAINS on a number of occasions when continuing to hang in and shifting in away from CAPTAIN AMERICA.  A veterinary inspection of CALIFORNIA ROCK immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The racing manners of CALIFORNIA ROCK were considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CALIFORNIA ROCK will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial.
When questioned regarding the performance of MIGHTY GAINS, D Whyte stated that his mount never had the opportunity to be balanced during the race due to CALIFORNIA ROCK shifting ground to its outside.  He said, in his opinion, whilst MIGHTY GAINS' performance was disappointing on face value, it could be explained by the circumstances of the race.  A veterinary inspection of MIGHTY GAINS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                MIZZEN GREY was hampered shortly after the start when crowded for room between TELECOM SUPREMO and IT CAN ONLY BE YOU (M L Yeung) which shifted in.  M L Yeung was advised that in similar circumstances he would be expected to make every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting in and causing interference to other horses.  After this, MIZZEN GREY was ridden along in an attempt to recover lost ground.
On jumping, BAMBOO DANCE was steadied away from the heels of MISTER MARC which shifted in.
From the outside barrier, HUMONGUS was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
In the early part of the Straight, MISTER MARC was disappointed for running between DARK SECRET and ENJOY THE GAME.
IT CAN ONLY BE YOU was found to have lost its right front plate during the running of the race.
When questioned regarding DARK SECRET being ridden in the lead, C Reith stated that in discussions with Mr D E Ferraris, the trainer of DARK SECRET, it was agreed that there appeared to be a lack of pace in the race.  He said whilst it would have been preferable for DARK SECRET to obtain cover in a forward position, this was not available to him due to the horse having drawn barrier 10 and the composition of the field in the early stages.  He said nonetheless DARK SECRET was able to dictate the tempo of the race and was then able to respond well when placed under pressure.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that THE ONLY KID travelled strongly until near the 500 Metres and he felt that at this time THE ONLY KID would finish off the race well.  He said however that THE ONLY KID came under pressure after this and then did not stretch out for the remainder of the race.  A veterinary inspection of THE ONLY KID immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of THE ONLY KID was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, THE ONLY KID will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Rounding the Home Turn, GREAT SKY and CHEETAH BOY raced tight due to CHEETAH BOY shifting out to obtain clear running.
In the Straight, CHEETAH BOY got its head on the side and lay out under pressure, resulting in GREAT SKY being inconvenienced in the early part of the Straight and again near the 100 Metres.
Throughout the race, RUMBA KING travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, D Whyte reported that he was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of CAGA FORCE.  He said the horse travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages, however, after coming under pressure near the 400 Metres was most disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race in the Straight.  Mr C S Shum, the trainer of CAGA FORCE, was unable to offer any explanation for the horse's disappointing performance other than it may not have been suited by the addition of blinkers.  He said he had studied the videos of CAGA FORCE, which was having its first start for his stable tonight, and he was of the belief that the horse was not finishing off its races.  He said it was for this reason that he applied blinkers to the horse.  He said CAGA FORCE's track work in this piece of gear had indicated that it would benefit from wearing it, however, in tonight's race, he felt the horse was inclined to race too keenly with the blinkers and therefore he would consider altering the horse's gear in its future starts.  A veterinary inspection of CAGA FORCE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of CAGA FORCE was considered unacceptable.

IMPERIAL CONCORDE had difficulty obtaining clear running rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight.
SURE CHAMP was held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight.
When questioned, N Callan stated that having ridden GO GO WIN previously in its races, track work and in trials, he has formed the view that GO GO WIN performs best when able to race outside horses and he had previously discussed this with Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of GO GO WIN.  He said from barrier 2, he had been instructed to try and come away from the rail if possible and avoid being cluttered up by other horses.  He said after allowing HURRY HURRY UP to cross to the lead, he steadied GO GO WIN with a view to taking up the position behind CRIMSON HEART which initially raced to the outside of the hindquarters of HURRY HURRY UP which would have allowed GO GO WIN the opportunity to race in a one-off position.  He said he had hoped that SAFARI MAGIC, which was racing to his outside in a three wide position, would then press on which would allow GO GO WIN the opportunity to shift out further.  He said however that after the 1300 Metres when he obtained the position behind CRIMSON HEART, that horse was steadied by its rider and shifted in behind HURRY HURRY UP rather than remaining to the outside of that horse.  He said this allowed SAFARI MAGIC the opportunity to improve and race outside CRIMSON HEART which had the effect of placing GO GO WIN back on the rail.  He added rounding the Home Turn he attempted to shift GO GO WIN outside CRIMSON HEART, however, GO GO WIN was momentarily hampered at the 400 Metres when disappointed for running between that horse and HOLY MAC.  He said then in the Straight GO GO WIN did not finish off the race and, in his opinion, this confirmed his belief that GO GO WIN does not appreciate racing amongst other horses.  He said near the 50 Metres he was momentarily inconvenienced when CRIMSON HEART shifted in, however, this had no bearing on the horse's final finishing position.  A veterinary inspection of GO GO WIN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

In the Straight, KA YING KID raced with its head on the side.
Throughout the race, REBORN TO WIN travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the performance of SO CAFFE, D Whyte stated that, in his opinion, the horse was disappointing tonight.  He said although SO CAFFE was not the best to begin, nonetheless the horse travelled very well after this in a position about midfield with cover.  He said at the entrance to the Straight he shifted SO CAFFE to the outside of runners as being a young horse, he believed this would provide SO CAFFE the best opportunity to close off the race.  He said however that SO CAFFE finished off the race only one-paced and, in his opinion, the horse should have finished off stronger given the run that it enjoyed throughout the race.

Passing the 150 Metres, NAZAKATâS LAD was bumped by VICTORY GENERAL which in turn was bumped by WHISTLE BLOWER which got its head on the side and shifted out.
Near the 50 Metres, VICTORY GENERAL was crowded for room between NAZAKATâS LAD and WHISTLE BLOWER (Z Purton) which continued to lay out under pressure.  Z Purton was advised that in similar circumstances he would be expected to make every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground.
Y T Cheng (WILD BOY) was fined $3,000 for improper use of the whip in that he raised weal marks over the horseâs left flank.  
When questioned, C Y Ho stated that he had been asked to endeavour to lead on CHINA POWER.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount vigorously for a considerable distance in the early and middle stages in order to have CHINA POWER as forward as possible, however, CHINA POWER was not able to show sufficient early speed and consequently raced behind midfield.  He said when continuing to ride his mount along, CHINA POWER was momentarily inconvenienced by TRENDIFUL near the 700 Metres when that horse shifted in.  He said after this he continued to push CHINA POWER along to improve his position.  He added at about the 600 Metres he was positioned slightly to the outside of TRENDIFUL, however, it did not appear to him that horses positioned in advance of TRENDIFUL and outside that horse were travelling well enough to take him into the race and therefore as DARK CORE was racing to the inside of TRENDIFUL and was under heavy pressure, he believed it was in the best interests of CHINA POWER to shift to the inside of TRENDIFUL and obtain clear running.  He said therefore after the 600 Metres he directed CHINA POWER in across the heels of TRENDIFUL with a view to establishing running to that horseâs inside, however, when doing so TRENDIFUL shifted in which resulted in CHINA POWER being awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse for some distance.  He said as a result of TRENDIFUL shifting in, this created a run to the outside of that horse as WHISTLE BLOWER, which was racing in advance of TRENDIFUL, was some distance in front of that horse.  He said consequently approaching the 300 Metres, he directed CHINA POWER to the outside of TRENDIFUL and the horse was then able to finish off the race strongly.  C Y Ho was advised that the Stewards were satisfied that he had made every endeavour to position his horse as forward as possible and that they accepted his reasons for attempting to shift to the inside of TRENDIFUL after the 600 Metres.  However, he was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have committed to the outside of that horse sooner than he did after TRENDIFUL shifted in, resulting in CHINA POWER being disappointed for running to the inside of that horse.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on CHINA POWER at the request of Trainer A T Millard.  The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, CHINA POWER will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said after being obliged to race worse than midfield due to having drawn 10, PERFECT TRIUMPH, over 1400 Metres, in his view, finished off the race satisfactorily as it was the first occasion that the horse, when trained by him, had been able to make up some ground in the Straight.  He said as he was of the opinion that PERFECT TRIUMPH is best suited over races of a longer distance, he stepped the horse up to 1600 Metres and when the horse drew barrier 1, he felt this would provide PERFECT TRIUMPH with the opportunity to run an improved race today.

Approaching the 300 Metres, FOREVER FUN, which was commencing to give ground, was steadied away from the heels of ABLE WARRIOR which shifted out after being bumped by GRAND CHAMPION.
Near the 200 Metres, ABLE WARRIOR was checked when crowded for room between MARK TWO which shifted in under pressure and YOUNG TALENT (N Callan) which shifted out.  As the Stewards were satisfied that N Callan had attempted to correct YOUNG TALENT within a reasonable amount of time of the horse shifting ground, they decided in the circumstances not to proceed to issue a charge of careless riding.  Nonetheless N Callan was severely reprimanded and advised that he must react as quickly as possible when horses shift ground in order to prevent causing interference to other runners.
OWNERSâ PRIDE was unable to obtain clear running until after the 200 Metres.

Throughout the race, DOUBLE DRAGON travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, M Chadwick stated that he had been asked to ride SEA SMOKE in a forward position.  He said in the early stages he had to ride his mount along to initially cross RAZOR QUEST and then BEAUTY JOURNEY which he was able to achieve near the 1100 Metres.  He said after shifting in to race outside POLYMER WIN, he attempted to steady SEA SMOKE with a view to allowing DOUBLE DRAGON, which was racing to his outside, to cross his mount which would provide SEA SMOKE with cover.  He added however that SEA SMOKE commenced to travel very keenly and when DOUBLE DRAGON was not ridden forward of SEA SMOKE, he was content to allow SEA SMOKE to race outside and slightly behind POLYMER WIN.
When questioned, N Callan stated that, from a wide barrier, he had to make considerable use of DOUBLE DRAGON in the early stages to obtain a forward position as instructed.  He said when YOU KNOW I WIN was steadied to obtain cover after the 1100 Metres, he was left racing in a three wide position outside SEA SMOKE which itself was racing outside POLYMER WIN.  He said as he saw that the rider of SEA SMOKE was attempting to steady that horse, he did consider pressing on with DOUBLE DRAGON into the outright lead, however, he felt that the race was being run at a quicker than standard tempo and given the amount of work DOUBLE DRAGON had had to do in the early stages, he did not believe it was in the best interests of the horse to then be ridden along in an attempt to cross those runners to his inside as he was of the view that DOUBLE DRAGON would then not be able to finish off the race were it to be ridden in this manner.  A veterinary inspection of DOUBLE DRAGON immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                AMBITIOUS CHAMPION began only fairly.
Approaching the 1400 Metres, BULLISH SMART, PRINCIPAL and AMBITIOUS CHAMPION were all badly crowded for room inside CLUB LIFE which shifted in away from ETON BLITZ despite the efforts of its rider, O Doleuze, to prevent CLUB LIFE from shifting in.  Accordingly no further action was taken.  After this, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION commenced to prove difficult to settle and after the 1300 Metres was steadied away from the heels of CLUB LIFE which shifted in when not properly clear.  In the circumstances, O Doleuze was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he provides sufficient clearance when shifting ground in similar circumstances.

BEST TANGO had difficulty obtaining clear running passing the 200 Metres.
BULLISH SMART was unable to obtain clear running at any stage in the Straight and consequently was not tested.
When questioned, O Doleuze stated that he had been instructed to ride CLUB LIFE positively, however, if the rider of another runner was intent on leading, he should take a seat off that horse.  He said CLUB LIFE began awkwardly and he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position as instructed.  He said passing the 1400 Metres CLUB LIFE became very awkward and he had to take measures to prevent CLUB LIFE from shifting ground and causing significant interference.  He said when he did this, EATON BLITZ was able to obtain a margin over CLUB LIFE and he elected to allow that horse to cross to the rail in the lead with a view to racing to its outside.  He said when AMBITIOUS CHAMPION was allowed to stride forward after the 900 Metres in advance of CLUB LIFE, he elected to allow that horse to continue in front of CLUB LIFE as he did not want to become engaged in a speed battle with that horse.  He added this provided CLUB LIFE with cover and he was able to shift to the outside of AMBITIOUS CHAMPION at the entrance to the Straight into clear running.

Then passing the 800 Metres, COSTA DEL SOL was checked and lost ground when again crowded inside COLUMBUS LINE which was racing tight inside LUCKY DAY.  As the Stewards were unable to satisfy themselves to the requisite degree that the incident resulted directly from a movement in from LUCKY DAY rather than that of COLUMBUS LINE, no further action was taken other than J Moreira was severely reprimanded and told to ensure that, wherever possible, he leaves comfortable racing room for runners on his inside.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of RAD, M L Yeung stated that his mount sweated up quite badly behind the barriers.  He said as he was asked to allow RAD to use its natural speed and if possible assume a position inside AMBER SKY, he rode his mount along in the early stages in order to comply with these instructions.  He said after travelling a short distance RAD was able to obtain a forward position, however, when he attempted to steady the horse after the 900 Metres, it commenced to travel keenly and would not relax.  He added he attempted for some distance after the 800 Metres to have RAD come back and race directly inside AMBER SKY rather than racing in advance of that horse, however, RAD still would not settle.  He said because of this when he placed the horse under pressure prior to the 400 Metres RAD immediately came off the bridle and then was most disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race.

SELKIRK STAR began only fairly.
GOOD GOOD VIEW was crowded for room at the start between SMART BALL and BORN TO WIN which began awkwardly and shifted out after leaning on the outside of its stall.
CONFUCIUS SPIRIT began awkwardly.
Near the 1350 Metres, FLYING UNICORN shifted out and bumped BORN TO WIN.
After the 1200 Metres, TARZAN I AM was hampered when crowded for room between MARVEL TRIBE and SHINY DAY, both of which shifted ground.  When MARVEL TRIBE was shifted out to relieve the tightening to TARZAN I AM, FOODIE, which was racing to that horseâs outside, was inconvenienced.
Passing the 700 Metres, GALAXY PRANCER, which was racing with its head on the side, was awkwardly placed inside the heels of BRILLIANT SHINE.
Near the 550 Metres, GALAXY PRANCER was checked when crowded for room inside BRILLIANT SHINE which shifted in marginally when being checked away from the heels of SHINY DAY.
Near the 150 Metres, SELKIRK STAR was accidentally struck across the nose by the whip of C K Tong (CONFUCIUS SPIRIT).  For a short distance after this, SELKIRK STAR was awkwardly placed inside the heels of CONFUCIUS SPIRIT.
Also near the 150 Metres, CONFUCIUS SPIRIT lost its left front plate.
Near the 100 Metres, Z Purton (BRILLIANT SHINE) dropped his whip when changing it into his right hand.
Throughout the race, SMART BALL travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, H W Lai stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on FLYING UNICORN which is the horseâs usual racing pattern.  He said he was asked to attempt to obtain the lead on the horse, however, if another runner was intent on pressing forward, it was available to him to take a sit on FLYING UNICORN rather than continuing to ride his mount forward.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages to clear runners to his inside and obtained a forward position.  He said near the 1100 Metres it became apparent to him that SMART BALL was being ridden forward to lead and he attempted to steady FLYING UNICORN to allow that horse to cross.  He said however that FLYING UNICORN would not settle at this time and he was not able to properly restrain the horse to allow SMART BALL to cross.  He said this resulted in the race being run at a fast tempo in the early and middle stages.  H W Lai was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he had failed to make sufficient endeavour to steady his mount after the 1100 Metres and his riding of FLYING UNICORN had resulted in the race being run at a fast tempo.  He was reprimanded and advised that his riding of FLYING UNICORN was not of a standard expected of a senior rider in Hong Kong and he must ride his mounts with sufficient judgement to ensure that they are able to close off their races.
BRILLIANT SHINE and MARVEL TRIBE were sent for sampling.

For some distance after the 700 Metres, LYRIC ACE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of KING OF SMARTS.
Approaching and passing the 200 Metres, FOREST COLOURS got its head on the side and lay in under pressure.
When questioned, Apprentice K C Ng (FOREST COLOURS) said that after obtaining a position behind TRAVEL MASTER at the 1000 Metres, he rode his mount along to maintain that position and so as not to allow LYRIC ACE, which at that time was racing to the outside of FOREST COLOURS, to shift in in front of FOREST COLOURS and obtain cover.  He said however that FOREST COLOURS did not respond to his urgings and rather than continuing to push his mount with the first turn approaching, he elected not to continue to pursue this position.
HAPPY GOAL and LYRIC ACE were sent for sampling.

BEAUTY ONLY began awkwardly.
CIRCUIT STAR began awkwardly and then shortly after the start was taken across behind runners.
Shortly after the start, BEST SHOW and DANEWIN EXPRESS bumped.
Also shortly after the start, SPARKLING B, which was being steadied in order to be shifted across behind runners, was steadied away from the heels of HEAVENISARACEHORSE which shifted out after being bumped by ARCHIPPUS.
From the outside barrier, AMBER DRAGON was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After the 800 Metres, DANEWIN EXPRESS and PRESIDENT LINCOLN raced tight inside MALAYAN PEARL before MALAYAN PEARL was shifted out to relieve the tightening to these runners.
ARCHIPPUS had difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
After the race, A Suborics reported that SPARKLING B did not stretch out in the Home Straight.  The performance of SPARKLING B, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SPARKLING B will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of PRESIDENT LINCOLN immediately following the race confirmed the horse to be a âroarerâ which had previously been reported.

                COOL PAL was withdrawn on 4.10.14 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (elevated muscle enzymes).  Before being allowed to race again, COOL PAL will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
KINGâS FOLKS was slow to begin.
MY CUP OVERFLOWS was crowded for room at the start between GOLD TALENT and ALL MY BENEFIT.
MONEY CAFE and MISTER MARC bumped heavily at the start as did SUPREME PROFIT and TELEPHATIA.
Near the 550 Metres, GOLD TALENT became badly unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by SUPREME PROFIT (J Moreira) which shifted out into tight running between GOLD TALENT and KINGâS FOLKS.  FLYING IN, which was following GOLD TALENT, was inconvenienced in consequence.  In this incident, SUPREME PROFIT also became unbalanced.  J Moreira was severely reprimanded and advised that whilst the Stewards encourage competitive riding, nonetheless when shifting ground he must ensure that he does not do so to the detriment of other runners.
SUPREME PROFIT was held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight and near the 400 Metres shifted in and made contact with KINGâS FOLKS.
Approaching the 300 Metres, ALL MY BENEFIT momentarily raced in restricted room between GOLD TALENT and MY CUP OVERFLOWS.
Approaching the 200 Metres, HAPPY KAISER, which was commencing to give ground, was bumped by SUPREME PROFIT which shifted out into clear running.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that whilst he had not been under any specific instructions on how to ride HAPPY KAISER, it was felt that if he was able to obtain a handy position with some cover from barrier 9, this would allow the horse the best opportunity to finish off its race, particularly given that it was carrying 131 lbs.  He said in the early stages he rode his mount along in an endeavour to obtain a position behind MONEY CAFE with cover, however, after persisting in an endeavour to obtain this position, he was left racing three wide without cover when ALL MY BENEFIT maintained its position to his inside.  He said whilst he did give consideration to going forward at this time, he felt that the pace was satisfactory and that the rider of MONEY CAFE would likely continue forward with HAPPY KAISER which would mean that HAPPY KAISER was left doing work and still having to race in a three wide position without cover.  He added therefore he elected to ensure the horse remained balanced and consequently HAPPY KAISER was required to race wide and without cover throughout the race.  B Prebble was advised that his explanation would be noted, however, given the tempo of the race after the 1200 Metres, in the opinion of the Stewards, HAPPY KAISERâs interests would have been best served by being allowed to improve its position at this time of the race to see if it was possible to cross MONEY CAFE rather than continuing to race in a three wide position.
When questioned, D Whyte stated that ALL MY BENEFIT was disappointing given that it enjoyed a good run behind the speed, however, when asked for an effort in the Straight ALL MY BENEFIT did not quicken and then failed to close off the race.  A veterinary inspection of ALL MY BENEFIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MY CUP OVERFLOWS, K Teetan stated that he had been asked to ride the horse positively and obtain a forward position.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages and was able to obtain a good position behind the speed.  He said MY CUP OVERFLOWS travelled well and at the entrance to the Straight he shifted the horse to the outside of runners to make its finishing run.  He said MY CUP OVERFLOWS came under pressure a short distance after this and rather than quicken in the early part of the Straight the horse then finished off the race only one-paced.  A veterinary inspection of MY CUP OVERFLOWS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of KINGâS FOLKS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
ALL MY BENEFIT, SUPREME PROFIT and GOLD TALENT were sent for sampling.
< 6/10/2014  Additional Veterinary Report> MY CUP OVERFLOWS, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer. He said at that time there were no significant findings. MY CUP OVERFLOWS was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer R Gibson this morning. He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its right front leg. Before being allowed to race again, MY CUP OVERFLOWS will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Near the 1300 Metres, UNIVERSAL UNION was momentarily awkwardly placed inside the heels of REAL SUPREME which got its head on the side and shifted in away from OVETT despite the efforts of its rider, M Chadwick. 
GREAT CHARM travelled wide and without cover until after the 700 Metres and then rounding the Home Turn raced tight with KIROV as KIROV shifted to the outside of REAL SUPREME into clear running.
Passing the 300 Metres, JAEGER BOMB, which was inclined to lay in, was steadied away from the heels of GREAT CHARM (D Whyte) which shifted out.  Then passing the 200 Metres, JAEGER BOMB was again steadied when crowded for room between GALLANT TRIUMPH and GREAT CHARM which continued to shift out.  D Whyte was advised to exercise more care.
Over the concluding stages, GREAT CHARM was awkwardly placed outside the heels of KIROV.  Because of this, GREAT CHARM was unable to be properly tested.

Shortly after the start, FOREVER GENKI became unbalanced when crowded for room between COLLAGEN and EASTERN PROMISE which was taken out by MONTE CASTELLO. 
Approaching the 900 Metres, BEAR-POP, which was travelling keenly, was steadied away from the heels of STARTLING POWER (C K Tong) which shifted in when not properly clear.  COLLAGEN, which was racing to the inside of BEAR-POP, was momentarily crowded for room in this incident.  C K Tong was severely reprimanded and advised to ensure that he provides sufficient clearance when shifting ground in future.
Making the turn after the 900 Metres, BEAR-POP was left racing wide and without cover.
Approaching the 600 Metres, BEAR-POP was awkwardly placed close to the heels of COLLAGEN which shifted out slightly.  In this incident, COLLAGEN lost its left hind plate.
Rounding the Home Turn, JOY TOGETHER got its head on the side and hung out and passing the 500 Metres was momentarily awkwardly placed outside the heels of LOVELY NAUGHTY which shifted out.
At the entrance to the Straight, BEAR-POP was taken wider by JOLLY SPRING which shifted to the outside of COLLAGEN into clear running.  LOVELY NAUGHTY, which was racing outside BEAR-POP, was initially taken out by that horse and then shifted further of its own accord, resulting in JOY TOGETHER and SOUTHCHINA COMMAND being hampered.
After the 100 Metres, SOUTHCHINA COMMAND was steadied when awkwardly placed outside the heels of LOVELY NAUGHTY.
After the race, C Y Ho (HECO RIDER) reported his saddle shifted back slightly in the Straight, placing him at a disadvantage.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MONTE CASTELLO, D Whyte stated that his mount travelled strongly throughout the early and middle stages.  He said at the entrance to the Straight he was able to shift out to take advantage of a run that had developed between COLLAGEN and LUCKY SCEPTER, however, MONTE CASTELLO immediately came off the bridle and was not able to improve into this run.  He said after this MONTE CASTELLO commenced to give ground and over the final 200 Metres the horseâs action deteriorated.  A veterinary inspection of MONTE CASTELLO immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, MONTE CASTELLO will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                DRAGON BACHELOR was slow to begin.
SPIRIT SOARING began awkwardly.
For some distance after the 1600 Metres, OCEAN POWER was awkwardly placed outside the heels of TERRIFIC MASTER.
After the 900 Metres, DRAGON PINS was left racing wide and without cover.
When questioned, Y T Cheng (FIGHTING BOY) stated that he had been asked to ride his mount in a forward position as it was felt that the race would be run at a slow tempo.  He said it was expected that SPIRIT SOARING might lead and if it was possible from barrier 4, he should attempt to obtain a position to the outside of that horse.  He said he rode his mount along in the early stages to obtain the position outside SPIRIT SOARING and was then able to race in a one-off position when SPIRIT SOARING shifted further towards the rail after the 1500 Metres.  He said he was content to allow FIGHTING BOY to maintain its position as FIGHTING BOY was travelling comfortably at what was, in his opinion, a slow tempo.  He added however that at the 1200 Metres FIGHTING BOY shifted out and bumped TERRIFIC MASTER after which FIGHTING BOY commenced to travel more keenly.  He said as SPIRIT SOARING was being steadied and given the tempo of the race to that point, he allowed FIGHTING BOY to stride forward to cross SPIRIT SOARING and raced on the rail in the lead rather than continue to steady his mount.  He said at no stage did he have to ride FIGHTING BOY along to obtain the lead but rather the horse was able to improve its position without having to be pressured.  He said given the way the race was being run at that time, he felt that this tactic provided FIGHTING BOY with the best opportunity to finish off the race as the horse was always travelling comfortably underneath him.  A veterinary inspection of FIGHTING BOY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to ride TERRIFIC MASTER in a midfield position, similar to when the horse was successful when ridden by him at its most recent start.  He said on that occasion he was obliged to ride TERRIFIC MASTER along in the early stages to obtain a midfield position whereas in contrast today, TERRIFIC MASTER began better than he expected and therefore he found himself in a forward position in the early stages.  He said for a considerable distance he attempted to steady TERRIFIC MASTER to obtain cover behind FIGHTING BOY, however, by the time he was able to shift in behind that horse near the 1600 Metres, SUPER STRIKE had been aggressively ridden to his inside and because of this he was not able to shift in.  He said when SPIRIT SOARING crossed to race on the rail and FIGHTING BOY followed that horse across, TERRIFIC MASTER was left racing in a three wide position without cover.  He added TERRIFIC MASTER then travelled keenly and would not relax for him, however, he endeavoured to maintain his position behind the speed albeit in a position three wide and without cover.  He said after the 1300 Metres OCEAN POWER was then ridden forward and he continued to steady TERRIFIC MASTER to obtain a position behind that horse.  He said however that when OCEAN POWER improved its position, TERRIFIC MASTER commenced to prove even more difficult to settle and, despite his efforts, he was not able to get the horse to relax.  He said accordingly he was not left with any other option other than to allow TERRIFIC MASTER to race outside of the leader FIGHTING BOY.  He added whilst TERRIFIC MASTER was proving very difficult to settle, the tempo of the race in the early stages did not assist the horse in settling as, in his opinion, the pace of the race until about the 1200 Metres was quite slow.  He said because of the manner in which TERRIFIC MASTER raced in the early and middle stages, the horse was then not able to finish off the race.  Mr A S Cruz, the trainer of TERRIFIC MASTER, confirmed that he had asked M L Yeung to ride the horse in a similar position to its most recent start.  He said after the horse was not able to obtain cover after beginning better than expected, it then would not settle given the tempo of the race.  He said whilst he was disappointed with the circumstances of the race, he was completely satisfied with Jockey Yeungâs handling given the manner in which the horse over-raced in what was a slowly run race in the early stages.  M L Yeung was advised that the video footage of the race and the sectional times of the relevant stages of the race supported his explanation and accordingly no further action was taken.  A veterinary inspection of TERRIFIC MASTER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of OCEAN POWER and GOLD TARTINI immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Also passing the 400 Metres, MIGHTY EQUUS was shifted in away from the heels of HOUSE OF LUCK.
Prior to the declaration of weighed-in, Mr C S Shum, the trainer of SPEEDY LONGWAH, made an application to the Stewards for that horse to be declared a non-runner.  After taking evidence from Mr Shum, M L Yeung, the rider of SPEEDY LONGWAH, and Mr T McGovern, the Starter, the Stewards found that just prior to the start being effected SPEEDY LONGWAH became fractious and reared, resulting in the horse losing ground.  The Stewards also found that during this incident the starting gate handler was attempting to assist SPEEDY LONGWAH and he released the horse in a timely manner given that it was in the act of rearing up.  As the Stewards believed that SPEEDY LONGWAH had been afforded a fair start, the horse was declared a runner.  Before being allowed to race again, SPEEDY LONGWAH will be required to perform satisfactorily in a stalls test.

He said approaching the first turn he was left racing in a three wide position and because of this near the 900 Metres he had to ride TWIN DELIGHT along to cross NUMERO UNO to his inside.  He said after shifting in to a one-off position, he noted that WINFULL PATROL was proving difficult to settle and as he felt that he had made enough use of TWIN DELIGHT to that point of the race, he was reluctant to ride the horse to cross WINFULL PATROL as he believed that it would then not be able to finish off its race.

                At declaration time, K Teetan was declared as the rider of both P J HALL and NO TIES.  It was established that K Teetan had a firm commitment to ride NO TIES.  As such, the Stewards permitted N Rawiller to be substituted as the rider of P J HALL.  For this declaration error, Trainer D J Hall was fined $2,000.
The Stewards were advised this morning by Dr P Curl, Executive Manager, Veterinary Regulation, that a review of the treatment records for runners declared for tonightâs racemeeting had revealed that NO TIES, trained by Mr P OâSullivan, had been administered the Club-authorized product, Kenacort-A, which contains the raceday prohibited substance triamcinolone acetonide on 30 September 2014, 7 clear days prior to tonightâs racemeeting.  He also advised that the Veterinary Surgeon allocated to Mr OâSullivanâs stable who administered the treatment to NO TIES had recommended a 18 clear day withdrawal period and not less than 14 clear days.  After this matter was brought to the attention of Mr OâSullivan, the Stewards acceded to an application submitted by him to withdraw NO TIES from this race and accordingly NO TIES was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  The Stewards were advised late this afternoon that the pre-race urine sample taken from NO TIES at approximately 5:30 this morning had shown an elevated level of triamcinolone acetonide.  The Stewards tonight interviewed Mr OâSullivan about this matter.  Also present were Mr P C Ng, assistant trainer allocated to Mr OâSullivanâs stable, and Dr Curl.  Mr OâSullivan subsequently pleaded guilty to a breach of Rule 50(2) in that as the person responsible for all matters pertaining to the running of his stable, he negligently entered and declared NO TIES to compete in this race when that horse had been treated with Kenacort-A, 7 clear days prior to this race, such clear day period being well inside the recommended withdrawal period as advised by the Clubâs Department of Veterinary Clinical Services.  After giving consideration to all the circumstances relating to this matter, the Stewards believed the appropriate penalty was for Mr OâSullivan to be fined the sum of $20,000.

In the early part of the Straight, GOLD PRECIOUS and SLEDGE HAMMER made contact as a result of GOLD PRECIOUS attempted to improve into tight running between MIGHTY GAINS and SLEDGE HAMMER.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to take up a forward position on P J HALL if possible.  He said as the start was effected, P J HALL lifted its front feet off the ground, leant against the inside of its stall and consequently was slow to begin.  He said whilst the opportunity was there for him to ride his mount along and attempt to race inside LUCKY BOLE, he did not feel the horse would have sufficient speed to maintain this position given the manner in which it began and therefore he elected to shift P J HALL out away from the rail which resulted in it racing further back in the field than had been anticipated.  He added P J HALL travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages, but did not finish off the race in the Straight.
When questioned, O Doleuze stated that whilst he had not been under any specific instructions on how to ride RISING POWER, it was felt that the horse may show some speed whilst fresh and be able to obtain a position behind the pace.  He said RISING POWER began very well and showed early speed and therefore he elected to use his initiative and allowed the horse to continue forward to eventually lead.  He added whilst it had not been anticipated that RISING POWER would be that far forward, the horse nonetheless performed well.
A veterinary inspection of LUCKY BOLE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

From a wide barrier, HOLY MAC was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Also from a wide barrier, SPICY SIAM was slow to begin and then was shifted across behind runners.
H W Lai (INDIGO WAY) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 1500 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of SMART PLANET, causing that horse to be taken in onto HOXO, resulting in HOXO being badly crowded for room and losing ground.  H W Lai was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 10 November 2014 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 26 October 2014.  For some distance after this, HOXO was then ridden along by its rider, K Teetan, to re-establish its position inside SMART PLANET.  This resulted in HOXO improving into very tight running inside SMART PLANET which continued to race tight inside INDIGO WAY which had improved its position to be racing tight inside the heels of KING OF PATCH.  Near the 1300 Metres, SMART PLANET was checked and lost ground when crowded for room between INDIGO WAY and HOXO which got its head on the side and shifted out when racing tight inside SMART PLANET.  K Teetan was advised that whilst there was some influence to this incident from horses to the outside of SMART PLANET and whilst the initial pressure to HOXO had not been as a result of his own doing, nonetheless he should be circumspect when continuing to endeavour to establish running where there is doubtful or insufficient room.

Passing the 1500 Metres, a piece of lead being carried underneath the saddle of K Teetan (ENJOY THE GAME) was dislodged.  It was subsequently ascertained that this piece of lead weighed 0.2 lb.  After initially weighing out at 119 lbs, Jockey Teetan weighed in at 118.9 lbs.  As the Rules provide that a rider is allowed 1 lb underweight, weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.  It was subsequently established that the piece of lead became dislodged as a result of the use of a defective lead bag which was supplied to Jockey Teetan by the Jockeys' Room valet.  This piece of gear was confiscated and the appropriate official was spoken to regarding the maintenance of gear.
The performance of LIBERAL OF MIND, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LIBERAL OF MIND will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the performance of MOBILE KING, N Rawiller stated that he had been instructed to lead or be close to the lead if possible.  He said however that as the start was effected, MOBILE KING lifted its front feet off the ground and because of this lost ground, resulting in the horse having to race back in the field and in a three wide position.  He said whilst MOBILE KING did not close off strongly, he felt that this was due to the circumstances given that MOBILE KING was not able to assume a forward position in the race.  A veterinary inspection of MOBILE KING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PERFECT TRIUMPH which was successful at its last start, W M Lai stated that the horse travelled fairly in the run and after initially quickening in the early part of the Straight, the horse's run ended at about the 200 Metres.  He said having this in mind, he recommended to connections that the 1800 Metres of today's race may have been too far at this stage of the horse's career and that PERFECT TRIUMPH may be better suited by being brought back in distance to 1600 Metres, a distance at which it was successful at its most recent start.

The Stewards opened an inquiry into H W Lai's riding of GOOD SMILE in the early and middle stages.  H W Lai said, as he expected, he had been instructed to lead in today's race.  He said he had anticipated receiving these instructions as he had previously ridden GOOD SMILE in a number of its races and the instructions had always been to go forward on the horse.  He said to the best of his knowledge, GOOD SMILE had not previously performed well when required to race with cover.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode along vigorously in the early stages, however, it was clear to him that GOOD SMILE would not show sufficient speed to clear HAPPY GOAL which was racing to his inside and which showed superior speed to GOOD SMILE.  He said therefore he elected near the 1100 Metres to stop riding his mount along and was content to assume the position racing outside HAPPY GOAL.  He added after the 1100 Metres it became apparent to him that CAPTAIN AMERICA was being ridden along to obtain a forward position and as he was of the view that this horse would also not show sufficient speed to cross HAPPY GOAL, he elected to ride his mount along in order to maintain the position outside HAPPY GOAL.  He said he did not want to allow CAPTAIN AMERICA to cross GOOD SMILE as the horse had not finished off its races when having to be ridden in this manner in the past.  He said for this reason he continued to niggle at GOOD SMILE to ensure that it held the position between HAPPY GOAL and CAPTAIN AMERICA so as to prevent CAPTAIN AMERICA from crossing GOOD SMILE.  He said at no stage had Trainer L Ho mentioned to him what the instructions were for HAPPY GOAL, a stablemate of GOOD SMILE, however, he anticipated that that horse would also be ridden to lead given that it had raced successfully recently in that position.  He added his instructions were given separately to K C Leung, the rider of HAPPY GOAL, in the Parade Ring.  Trainer Ho confirmed that he had given both K C Leung and H W Lai similar instructions, that was to go forward and lead.  He said both horses are noted to race best when dictating races.  He said he expected that HAPPY GOAL would show superior speed to GOOD SMILE as that horse had race fitness whereas GOOD SMILE was first up in today's race since June.  He added at no stage did he inform either K C Leung or H W Lai what the instructions were for the horse they were not riding.  When questioned, K C Leung stated that the instructions he had been provided for HAPPY GOAL were given in the Parade Ring by Mr Ho in the presence of the owners.  He said he had been instructed to lead and he had anticipated that this would be the case given that HAPPY GOAL raced successfully last start over the course and distance when leading.  He said no reference was made as to how GOOD SMILE would be ridden either prior to or when the instructions were given by Mr Ho.  H W Lai was advised that his riding of a horse had previously come under notice this season and similarly his riding of GOOD SMILE in persisting to maintain his position outside HAPPY GOAL also came under notice.  He was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to be given the opportunity to close off their races and so as to ensure that his riding is not open to query.  Mr Ho was advised that his evidence was noted.

After the race, C Y Ho (HARBOUR DELIGHT) reported that after the 1000 Metres his mount lay out and then making the turn after the 800 Metres got its head on the side and hung out.  He said this made HARBOUR DELIGHT difficult to ride.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HAPPY CENTENARY, G Mosse stated that the horse travelled well in a three wide position with cover behind SUCCESSFUL LEADER.  He said however that near the 550 Metres HAPPY CENTENARY became unbalanced after being awkwardly placed close to the heels of SUCCESSFUL LEADER and consequently he was obliged to shift out away from the heels of that horse.  He said when this happened, HAPPY CENTENARY immediately came off the bridle and did not stretch out after this.  He added, in his opinion, the horse is one-paced and generally closes off its races, however, having had a stride broken at the 550 Metres did not suit the horse's finishing style.  A veterinary inspection of HAPPY CENTENARY immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horse's trachea.  The performance of HAPPY CENTENARY, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HAPPY CENTENARY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of HEY CHEERS immediately following the race revealed that the horse was displaying an irregular heart rhythm.

He said in the early stages it was apparent to him that BEAUTY JOURNEY would be left racing wide if he endeavoured to obtain a forward position, therefore he elected to steady BEAUTY JOURNEY and was able to obtain a trailing position behind the eventual winner ULTIMATE GLORY.

TURBO JEWELLERY, which was following, was hampered in consequence.  Taking into consideration the circumstances of this matter and the nature of the interference suffered by GRACEFUL KINGDOM and GOOD GOOD VIEW, the Stewards believed the appropriate penalty was for N Rawiller to be suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 10 November 2014 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 26 October 2014.

Having regard to the significance of this incident and MASTER SOMMELIER's previous record in respect of being difficult to manage, the Stewards ruled that the horse must undergo a series of not less than three consecutive official barrier trials around a bend before being allowed to race again.

Throughout the race, SKY FAR travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding his riding of NOVEL START, C Y Ho stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 11, to allow his mount to go forward if possible in the early stages, but not to make too much use of the horse as the connections did not want NOVEL START being caught wide and without cover in a position towards the lead.  He said after NOVEL START began well, he immediately noticed that SKY FAR, REAL FIT and a number of other runners drawn more favourably being aggressively ridden to obtain forward positions and he believed he would have had to make too much use of NOVEL START in an endeavour to cross those runners to its inside.  He said therefore he took hold of NOVEL START shortly after the start and attempted to shift that horse in behind runners to obtain cover in about a midfield position.  He said however that NOVEL START proved difficult to settle making the turn after the 900 Metres and he was not able to shift the horse in and this resulted in NOVEL START racing very wide and without cover.  Mr T K Ng, the trainer of NOVEL START, confirmed the instructions given to C Y Ho and stated that NOVEL START had previously weakened in its races when obliged to race wide and without cover.  He said he felt that if the horse was not able to obtain the lead without having to be aggressively ridden, it was in NOVEL STARTâs best interests to attempt to obtain cover in the hope that it could close off the race.

Near the 100 Metres, FIRST SIGHT LOVE was shifted to the inside of the heels of HOLMES LEGEND to continue improving.
When questioned, A Suborics (WHY NOT) stated that when FUN RIDER improved around the field after the 700 Metres, he did consider shifting out behind that horse near the 600 Metres and follow it forward.  He said however that HOLMES LEGEND had attempted to shift out making the turn near the 550 Metres and had he continued forward with FUN RIDER, he was concerned that WHY NOT would be taken unnecessarily wide by HOLMES LEGEND when that horse shifted out.  He said as the tempo of the race at this time was quite good, he elected to remain racing behind HOLMES LEGEND until the entrance to the Straight.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BORN TO WIN, C Y Ho stated that he was able to dictate the race from the front and was able to set a steady tempo.  He said after enjoying an uncontested lead, BORN TO WIN became unbalanced making the Home Turn and was inclined to lay away from the rail.  He said in the Straight he placed BORN TO WIN under pressure, however, the horse gave ground and was most disappointing.  He added he had ridden BORN TO WIN in its track work in the lead up to tonightâs race and this work, in his opinion, was good and based on the horseâs track work, a forward showing was expected.

He said given the tempo of the race in the early and middle stages, he expected INVICTUS to quicken rounding the Home Turn, however, when placed under pressure, the horse immediately came off the bridle and then did not close off the race.  He said whilst INVICTUS was disappointing, the track conditions may have played a part in the horseâs performance.

When questioned regarding the improved performance of SEMPITERNAL, Trainer W Y So stated that at its final run last season the horse had performed well when able to be ridden in a about a midfield position.  He said due to the make-up of the field at its first up run this season, it was hoped that the horse may be able to take up a similar position, however, on jumping SEMPITERNAL, which was fractious in the barriers, reared as the start was effected and lost ground which resulted in it having to race further back in the field than had been anticipated.  He said because he was disappointed with the manner in which SEMPITERNAL began that race, he barrier trialed the horse afterwards and prior to todayâs race with the primary objective being to get it to begin well.  He said as it was anticipated that todayâs race would be run at a slow tempo, he instructed C K Tong, the rider of SEMPITERNAL, to ensure, as best as he could, that the horse began well and to take up a forward position if possible.  He added, in his opinion, todayâs improved performance could be attributed to the fact that the horse was able to begin its race well which had the result of it being able to race in a forward position.

When questioned regarding his riding of GREAT CHARM, particularly rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, O Doleuze stated that he had been instructed to ride GREAT CHARM quietly with cover in the early stages as the horse was coming back in distance to 1200 Metres and particularly due to it over-racing at its most recent start when left without cover.  He said it was hoped that the anticipated faster tempo of todayâs race would allow GREAT CHARM the opportunity to finish off the race with more purpose.  He said in accordance with his instructions he shifted GREAT CHARM across behind runners in the early stages and the horse travelled comfortably in the early and middle stages.  He said passing the 600 Metres he was positioned behind STRATHMORE and HIGH AND MIGHTY and it was his intention to shift to the outside as GREAT CHARM had previously finished off its races well when being able to be positioned outside horses.  He said although a run presented itself rounding the Home Turn between HIGH AND MIGHTY and STRATHMORE which was shifting out, he was reluctant to improve into this position due to his intention to get GREAT CHARM to the outside of runners.  He said in any case the run between HIGH AND MIGHTY and STRATHMORE closed at about the 400 Metres when both those horses shifted ground.  He added shortly after the 400 Metres he directed GREAT CHARM to the outside of HIGH AND MIGHTY and considered taking a run between that horse and GOLDEN DEER, however, he was aware that HARD BALL GET was racing in advance of these horses and as that horse did not appear to be closing off the race strongly, he was reluctant to allow GREAT CHARM to improve between HIGH AND MIGHTY and GOLDEN DEER, therefore he elected to continue to shift to the outside of GOLDEN DEER which he was able to do at the 300 Metres.  He said he was then able to place GREAT CHARM under pressure, however, approaching the 200 Metres he had to shift GREAT CHARM out further to avoid the heels of GOLDEN DEER which shifted out under pressure.  He added after the 200 Metres once he shifted to the outside of GOLDEN DEER, he was able to again place GREAT CHARM under full pressure and the horse finished off the race well.  Mr R Gibson, the trainer of GREAT CHARM, advised that his sole instruction had been to have GREAT CHARM relaxed during the run due to the manner in which it over-raced at its most recent start.  He said he asked Jockey Doleuze to ensure that GREAT CHARM obtained corer and be given the opportunity to finish off the race strongly.  O Doleuze was advised that the Stewards would note his evidence, however, he must at all times ensure that he takes advantages of opportunities to improve his position when they become available.  A veterinary inspection of GREAT CHARM, immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of STRATHMORE and JOYFUL THE GREAT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Before being allowed to race again, GREAT CHARM will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
STRATHMORE, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer.  He said at that time there were no significant findings. STRATHMORE was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer A T Millard this morning. He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its right front leg. Before being allowed to race again, STRATHMORE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Throughout the race, COSMO ONE travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, K C Leung (HAPPY GOAL) stated that he had been asked to lead on the rail if possible.  He said it was felt that the main impediment to HAPPY GOAL being able to obtain the lead would be SIR JOHN which had drawn barrier 1.  He said he was instructed that in the event HAPPY GOAL was not able to cross SIR JOHN and obtain the rail, then he should sit outside that horse.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode HAPPY GOAL vigorously in the early stages after being crowded for room on jumping.  He said despite being aggressively ridden, HAPPY GOAL did not show the early speed that he expected, however, he continued to ride the horse along in order to comply with his instructions.  He said although it soon became apparent to him that he would not be able to clear SIR JOHN which began very well, he continued to ride HAPPY GOAL aggressively for the first 200 Metres in order to prevent ENJOY THE FUN from being able to cross HAPPY GOAL.  He said at all stages racing along the Back Straight, ENJOY THE FUN held a margin over HAPPY GOAL and bearing in mind that he had ridden the horse along for such a sustained period in the early stages, he felt it was in the best interests of HAPPY GOAL not to continue riding it along as ENJOY THE FUN was always racing in advance of HAPPY GOAL and he felt that he would have had to make unnecessary use of HAPPY GOAL to prevent ENJOY THE FUN from crossing and consequently HAPPY GOAL would not be able to finish off its race.  He added after being crossed by ENJOY THE FUN near the 800 Metres, HAPPY GOAL then commenced to prove very difficult to settle and had to be continually checked away from the heels of that horse until after the 600 Metres.  He said in this time HAPPY GOAL became unbalanced on a number of occasions after getting its head up when racing close to the heels of ENJOY THE FUN.  Mr L Ho, the trainer of HAPPY GOAL, confirmed Jockey Leungâs advice on how he had asked for HAPPY GOAL to be ridden.  He said whilst he had concerns that HAPPY GOAL may not have been able to cross SIR JOHN, he felt that the horse had sufficient speed to be able to obtain a position outside that horse, however, it was apparent to him that despite Jockey Leung making a more than reasonable effort to comply with his instructions, HAPPY GOAL did not display the early speed today that it had shown in its recent races.  He added HAPPY GOAL had trained on very well since its last start success and the only reason he could put forward for the horseâs failure to show more pace in the early stages was that HAPPY GOAL had climbed steadily in weights which may have impacted upon the horseâs early speed today.  After considering the evidence and viewing the videos, the Stewards advised K C Leung that they accepted his evidence and were satisfied that he had given HAPPY GOAL full opportunity to take up a leading position if it was so able.  A veterinary inspection of HAPPY GOAL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Throughout the race, GUN PIT and DR GOOD HABIT travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding his riding of SMILING WATCH, Apprentice K C Ng stated that it was agreed between himself and Trainer K L Man that SMILING WATCH should be ridden in a forward position from barrier 13 as the horse was carrying a light weight and there was only a limited number of horses in the field that were expected to take up forward positions.  He said it was felt that SMILING WATCH would be able to overcome its wide barrier and be able to dictate the terms of the race.  He said after crossing into the lead near the 1300 Metres, he immediately attempted to steady the tempo on SMILING WATCH, however, the horse would not relax and, despite his attempts, was running at a faster tempo than he had hoped.  He added he was reluctant to restrain his mount any further as he did not want it to become unbalanced, nonetheless he believed that he had made a reasonable effort to steady the tempo on SMILING WATCH so that it could finish off the race.  Apprentice Ng was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must ride his mounts with sufficient judgement to ensure that, wherever possible, they are able to finish off their races.

When questioned regarding his riding of WILD BOY, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to have the horse racing in a forward position and if possible position WILD BOY behind the leaders.  He said on jumping WILD BOY and EXCITABLE BOY bumped and then after travelling a short distance WILD BOY was steadied away from the heels of EXCITABLE BOY which shifted out.  He said at this time he received a call from his outside and as he felt that he may have caused interference to his outside as a result of the shift from EXCITABLE BOY, he steadied his mount to allow that horse to continue forward.  He said after the 900 Metres he commenced to ride his mount along to see if it could improve its position and at this time he slapped the horse down the shoulder with the whip.  He said despite this, WILD BOY did not show the speed in the early stages that he expected.  He said near the 800 Metres DIAMOND MASTER was being vigorously ridden to his inside, was racing greenly and was shifting out towards the line of WILD BOY.  He added that he had considered riding WILD BOY along more vigorously at this time to hold his position, however, he felt that the manner in which DIAMOND MASTER was racing may have resulted in interference being suffered by WILD BOY and therefore he elected to allow DIAMOND MASTER to improve forward of WILD BOY.  He said whilst this resulted in WILD BOY racing further back in the field than had been anticipated, he did not believe that WILD BOY was showing sufficient early speed to consolidate its position outside DIAMOND MASTER at this time.  He said as soon as he allowed DIAMOND MASTER to improve forward of WILD BOY approaching the 500 Metres, he immediately commenced to ride his mount along to improve its position.  He said whilst WILD BOY initially took some time to gather momentum, the horse then closed off the race well over the latter stages.  M L Yeung was advised that the Stewards had concerns regarding his riding of WILD BOY in the early stages.  He was told that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have made a far greater endeavour to obtain a forward position than he did on this occasion.  He was also told to ensure that he rides his mounts in order to comply with his instructions wherever possible and to leave no room for query as to his intentions to fulfil those instructions.  A veterinary inspection of WILD BOY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

After improving inside the heels of FUN âNâ GAMES (N Callan) after the 800 Metres, SIGHT BELIEVER was hampered and shifted in away from that horse which shifted in before being corrected by its rider.  In the circumstances, N Callan was severely reprimanded and advised to ensure that he is sufficiently clear when shifting ground in similar circumstances.
Passing the 300 Metres, CHARITY JOY was awkwardly placed close to the heels of YOU READ MY MIND after being disappointed for running between that horse and FUN âNâ GAMES which shifted in.  Then passing the 250 Metres, CHARITY JOY and FUN âNâ GAMES raced tight as CHARITY JOY shifted out into clear running.
After the race, D Whyte (CHARITY JOY) reported that his saddle shifted back in the early stages.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of ADEPTO, J Moreira stated that the horse became stirred up behind the barriers and commenced to sweat up.  He said, from its inside draw, ADEPTO was able to obtain a good position in about midfield behind the eventual winner CHARITY JOY.  He said however that making the turn after the 600 Metres ADEPTO got  its head on the side, lay out and lost its action.  He added the horse continued to lay out and rounding the Home Turn came under extreme pressure.  He said despite being ridden out in the early part of the Straight, ADEPTO never fully regained its balance and consequently weakened out of the race.  He said, in his opinion, the performance of ADEPTO could be attributed to the horse having its first start in Hong Kong and having not had experience at Happy Valley.  A veterinary inspection of ADEPTO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of ADEPTO, a favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, ADEPTO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

For the majority of the race, ALL WIN BOY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, M Demuro stated that, from the wide barrier, he had been asked to shift LONDON WALK across behind runners in the early stages as the horse had performed well in the past when ridden by him from towards the rear of the field.  He said he had hoped to make his run in between horses in the Straight if possible as this had been the scenario when he had ridden the horse to success previously.  He said in the early and middle stages LONDON WALK got out of its ground due to the good tempo of the race and he was obliged to improve around YOUNG RANGER along the Back Straight in order to take closer order to the body of the field.  He said making the turn at the 1000 Metres he noted that LONDON WALK lost its left hind plate.  He said making the turn after the 600 Metres he did not believe that it was going to be available to take inside runs as there were a number of horses in advance of LONDON WALK and therefore he elected to shift LONDON WALK to the outside of KIROV after the 500 Metres.  He added in the early part of the Straight he balanced up LONDON WALK and shifted it to the outside of ALL WIN BOY, however, approaching the 200 Metres was hampered and taken wider due to a shift out from his inside.  He said he commenced to ride LONDON WALK out with the whip in the left hand, however, near the 100 Metres when being fully tested LONDON WALK shifted in under pressure, therefore he elected to put the whip away and continued to ride it out to the end of the race hands and heels.  M Demuro was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must ensure that he rides his mounts out with sufficient vigour so as to leave no room for query.

Z Purton (MIGHTY GAINS) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 800 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of KINGSTON JUMBO, causing that horse to be checked and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  Z Purton was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 8 December 2014 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting to be conducted on Sunday, 30 November 2014.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into consideration Jockey Purtonâs good race riding record during the most recent 2013/2014 and current racing seasons.
Making the turn approaching the 700 Metres, TANG PALACE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of XI YING MEN.

When parading behind the barriers, MODERN TSAR and LITTLE DRAGON made contact.  Both MODERN TSAR and LITTLE DRAGON were examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion they were suitable to race.
SHORT SQUEEZE and THE SYLPH were slow to begin.
From wide barriers, TERRIFIC MASTER and DIVINE DIYA were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.

Near the 1200 Metres, DIVINE DIYA shifted out when awkwardly placed close to the heels of LITTLE DRAGON.
On a number of occasions along the Back Straight and making the turn out of the Back Straight, THE SYLPH got its head up and proved very difficult to settle.  After speaking with K Teetan regarding this matter and having in mind that this was the second occasion that THE SYLPH had proved very difficult to settle in its races from only two starts in Hong Kong, the Stewards ruled that prior to the being permitted to race again, the horse will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial around a bend.
Near the 600 Metres, THE SYLPH was steadied away from the heels of SO CAFFE.
For the major part of the race, BERLINI travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, C Y Ho stated that he could offer no explanation for the disappointing performance of GRAND ELITE as he expected the horse to quicken well in the Straight given that it had enjoyed a good run throughout the race.  A veterinary inspection of GRAND ELITE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of GRAND ELITE, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.

CASA JUNIOR began awkwardly, shifted in and was awkwardly placed outside the heels of ORIENTAL FANTASIA.
BLISS CARTEL and LA COTE DE BLEU, which began awkwardly, were crowded for room shortly after the start between ALLEY-OOP and ISLAND SPRING which shifted in.
EVERYONEâS CHOICE began awkwardly.
Near the 1100 Metres, EVERYONEâS CHOICE was steadied out away from the heels of TAI PO FORTUNE which shifted in when just clear.  As EVERYONEâS CHOICE then attempted to shift out to a one-off position outside TAI PO FORTUNE, EVERYONEâS CHOICE and BLISS CARTEL made contact for some distance as BLISS CARTEL shifted in simultaneously to assume the same position.  As the Stewards were of the opinion that in this incident both riders were attempting to obtain a position to the outside of TAI PO FORTUNE and that neither runner had properly established that run prior to the contact between the horses, no further action was taken.
Making the turn after the 900 Metres, TAI PO FORTUNE got its head up when proving difficult to settle and awkwardly placed close to the heels of ORIENTAL FANTASIA.
Near the 350 Metres, OPTIMIZATION STAR was shifted to the outside of LOTUS LOVE to obtain clear running.
When questioned regarding his riding of EVERYONEâS CHOICE after the 600 Metres, N Callan stated that he elected to shift out from behind TAI PO FORTUNE when BLISS CARTEL, which was racing to EVERYONEâS CHOICE outside, came under pressure.  He said at this time he wanted EVERYONEâS CHOICE to improve to the outside of TAI PO FORTUNE as that horse seemed to be travelling better than the two leaders.  He said as EVERYONEâS CHOICE had momentum up, he elected to continue to ride his mount along whilst shifting to the outside of LUCKY BOLE at the entrance to the Straight.  He said whilst this resulted in EVERYONEâS CHOICE having to make a somewhat sustained run, he felt that it was in EVERYONEâS CHOICEâs best interests at that time to gather momentum.  He added he had ridden the horse in a similar manner at its last start and it was able to respond well when ridden in this fashion.  He said it was over the final 200 Metres that EVERYONEâS CHOICE came under pressure and the manner in which the horse wanted to shift ground over the concluding stages indicated to him that it did not appear to be completely comfortable on todayâs surface.
After the race, J Moreira reported that ORIENTAL FANTASIA raced most disappointingly as the horse came under pressure at the entrance to the Straight and then did not respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of ORIENTAL FANTASIA immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.

FUJIAN SPIRIT, which proved reluctant to load, became fractious in the barriers and reared on a number of occasions.  Having regard to FUJIAN SPIRITâs previous record in respect of its barrier behaviour, the Stewards ruled that the horse must barrier trial satisfactorily before being permitted to race again.

When questioned regarding his riding of BERLINSKI in the early part of the Straight, U Rispoli stated that he had been instructed if possible to follow LUGER in the race until about the 250 Metres at which time the horse should be produced to make its finishing run.  He said it was explained to him that BERLINSKI has a relatively short sprint and it was felt that holding up BERLINSKI for a final run would give the horse the best opportunity to win the race.  He said after racing inside LUGER after the 600 Metres, he allowed his mount to improve its position in the early part of the Straight as LUGER was clearly not travelling well enough to take him into the race.  He said therefore he improved his position to be racing behind SECRET SHAM, a horse he considered would finish off strongly.  He added although a run to the outside of SECRET SHAM and inside BULLISH BOY, which was giving ground, became available approaching the 300 Metres, he directed BERLINSKI back in behind SECRET SHAM as his instructions were to wait until about the 250 Metres.  He said when he reached the 250 Metres, he immediately shifted BERLINSKI to the outside of SECRET SHAM and rode the horse vigorously to the end of the race.  He said when ridden in this manner, BERLINSKI finished off the race strongly.  Trainer D J Hall advised the Stewards that he had made specific mention of the fact that BERLINSKI has a relatively limited sprint and he asked Jockey Rispoli to follow LUGER for as long as possible in the race as he considered it to be the best horse to follow.  He said at its first run this season, Z Purton had advised him that BERLINSKI was going to finish off the race strongly, however, the horse did not sustain its run like he thought it would and because of this it had confirmed his previous opinion that BERLINSKI needs to be held up in races for as long as possible so that its finishing run can be effective.  U Rispoli was advised that the Stewards did not have any concern regarding his riding of BERLINSKI at any other stage of the race and that whilst he had shifted BERLINSKI back in behind SECRET SHAM for a short distance, he had been riding the horse along throughout, nonetheless his riding at this time of the race had the potential to draw attention upon himself and he must ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so as to leave no room for query.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of VICTORIUS, J Moreira stated that it had been his intention if at all possible to shift VICTORIUS to the outside of runners as the horse had previously finished off its races best when ridden in this manner.  He said because of the circumstances of tonightâs race, he was required to race amongst runners as he was not able to shift the horse to the extreme outside.  He said, in his opinion, VICTORIUS appeared reluctant to stretch out in amongst horses and although it quickened somewhat rounding the Home Turn, the horse was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of VICTORIUS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of INCREDIBLE FELLOW, M Chadwick stated that he had been asked to lead if possible, however, if INCREDIBLE FELLOW, which was having its first race start at Happy Valley tonight, was not able to lead, he should obtain a position behind the speed.  He said after being bumped by SPITFIRE at the start, he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, near the 1150 Metres was awkwardly placed outside the heels of SPITFIRE when that horse shifted out.  He said he then rode his mount along in an endeavour to comply with his instructions, however, INCREDIBLE FELLOW did not show the anticipated early speed and as such was obliged to race further back in the field than had been hoped.  He added INCREDIBLE FELLOW was left racing wide and without cover in the middle stages and for this reason he rode his mount along to improve his position prior to the 600 Metres to race in a position one horse off the rail.  He said as soon as he was able to shift in from three wide into a two wide position, INCREDIBLE FELLOW, near the 500 Metres, immediately came off the bridle and appeared to him to lose interest in the race.  He said despite being vigorously ridden, INCREDIBLE FELLOW did not respond and in the Straight gave ground.  A veterinary inspection of INCREDIBLE FELLOW immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of INCREDIBLE FELLOW, which weakened noticeably in the Straight, was considered unacceptable.

As BULLISH SMART shifted out away from the heels of HORSE APLENTY, it was checked when crowded for room between HORSE APLENTY and TAKE TO THE LIMIT which had commenced to shift in to race outside HORSE APLENTY prior to BULLISH SMART shifting out.  H W Lai was severely reprimanded and told that whilst the Stewards were mindful of the racing manners of BULLISH SMART at this time, nonetheless the manner in which he had steadied the tempo had contributed to this incident.

When questioned, M L Yeung stated that in pre-race discussions with Mr C S Shum, the trainer of GORGEOUS DEBUT, it was felt that the race would be run at a good tempo as there were a number of horses which had shown good pace in their previous races.  He said it was therefore felt that a lot of use would have to be made of GORGEOUS DEBUT in an endeavour to cross runners from its wide barrier and that the likely outcome would be that GORGEOUS DEBUT would be left racing wide.  He said therefore he was asked to attempt to obtain a position in about midfield with cover.  He said after shifting GORGEOUS DEBUT across in the early stages, his mount commenced to over-race approaching the 900 Metres and got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of KEY WITNESS.  He added whilst GORGEOUS DEBUT was obliged to race wide, he had some cover until approaching the 600 Metres at which time the horse was left racing wide and without cover.  He said GORGEOUS DEBUT then did not close off the race when placed under pressure in the Straight.  Mr Shum advised that he was concerned about where GORGEOUS DEBUT would end up if ridden for speed as is usual given the make-up of todayâs field.  He said he felt it was in the horseâs best interests to endeavour to obtain cover to see if it would be able to finish off the race.
When questioned, G Mosse stated that he had been asked to ride KEY WITNESS behind the speed with cover from the outside barrier.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he allowed KEY WITNESS to shift across with runners in the early stages in the hope that the field would break up sufficiently to allow KEY WITNESS to obtain cover.  He said however that when PRECISION KING shifted out approaching the 900 Metres when unable to cross IâM IN CHARGE, KEY WITNESS was left racing in a four wide position and without cover.  He said therefore he elected to improve his position to race outside the leaders, however, continued to race wide and without cover.  Trainer A S Cruz stated that he felt were KEY WITNESS to be taken behind runners in the early stages, the horse would get too far out of its ground and would therefore have too much to do in the Straight.  He said KEY WITNESS, which was racing in blinkers for the second time today, travelled keener than he anticipated and because of this was not able to obtain cover.  He added it had been hoped that the pace of the race would be sufficient to allow KEY WITNESS the opportunity to obtain cover.

When questioned regarding the performance of FRUITFUL CHAMPION, B Prebble stated that it had been hoped, from barrier 12, that he may be able to obtain a position in midfield with cover, however, due to the circumstances of the race, he was required to settle back further than had been hoped which resulted in FRUITFUL CHAMPION racing behind midfield.  He said making the first turn FRUITFUL CHAMPION got its head on the side and hung out which it continued to do rounding the turns.

GOLDEN HARVEST had some difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
LUCKY NINE lost its right hind plate passing the 400 Metres.
Passing the 350 Metres, AEROVELOCITY became unbalanced when attempting a run inside AMBER SKY where there was insufficient room.  In this incident, AEROVELOCITY and SUPER JOCKEY made contact, causing both horses to become unbalanced.
Near the 250 Metres, AEROVELOCITY was checked after endeavouring to obtain a run to the inside of AMBER SKY (M Demuro) which, after initially shifting out marginally, then shifted back in to resume its position.  As the Stewards were of the opinion that the shift outwards from AMBER SKY was only slight and that they were not comfortably satisfied that that horse had assumed a position one horse off the fence, the Stewards therefore believed that AEROVELOCITY had not properly established running to the inside of AMBER SKY prior to that horse shifting back in.  As a consequence, no further action was taken other than to advise M Demuro to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground in future.
Passing the 150 Metres, AEROVELOCITY was again held up for clear running behind AMBER SKY and passing the 100 Metres was checked when disappointed for running inside that horse where there was insufficient room.
STERLING CITY was unable to obtain clear running over the final 300 Metres and consequently was not able to be tested.
LUCKY NINE was badly held up for clear running until passing the 200 Metres.

Throughout the race, PENIAPHOBIA travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SPALATO, J McDonald stated that although he had ridden his mount along in the early stages to obtain a forward position, from barrier 13, he was able to shift in to settle just off the speed but in a three wide position.  He said after obtaining this position passing the 900 Metres, SPALATO then travelled well, however, in the early part of the Straight did not quicken as he thought it would and initially stayed on just one-paced.  He added the particularly disappointing aspect of SPALATOâs run today was the manner in which it weakened out of the race over the final 200 Metres, a stage of the race where the horse had previously been strongest when he had ridden it before.  He said whilst SPALATO weakened out of the race over the concluding stages, he believed this could not be attributed entirely to the horse being required to race three wide and without cover throughout.  A veterinary inspection of SPALATO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
The Stewards subsequently opened an inquiry into a report following the race that SPALATO had briefly exhibited a restricted action in its right hind leg in the stable prior to being presented to race.  After taking evidence from Mr J OâHara, the trainer of SPALATO, and Dr P Curl, Executive Manager, Veterinary Regulation, the inquiry was adjourned until a date to be fixed so that the Stewards could view the CCTV coverage of the horseâs stable block as well as receiving reports relative to follow-up veterinary examinations to be conducted on SPALATO.

When questioned regarding the performance of WINNER ST PAULâS, which was having its first race start in Hong Kong tonight, Z Purton stated that his mount raced greenly throughout the race and was reluctant to maintain its position inside other runners.  He said because of this he was obliged to ride his mount along aggressively in the early and middle stages in order to have it maintain its position inside MERIDIAN TREASURE.  He said approaching the 500 Metres he rode his mount along to take advantage of comfortable running which was available inside WHISTLE BLOWER when that horse hung out.  He said when WHISTLE BLOWER shifted back in slightly to resume its position racing one horse off the rail approaching the 400 Metres, WINNER ST PAULâS was again reluctant to maintain its position inside that horse and became badly unbalanced.  He added he rode his mount along to have it concentrate and to maintain its position inside WHISTLE BLOWER, however, rounding the Home Turn WINNER ST PAULâS brushed the running rail and again became badly unbalanced which resulted in the horse blundering shortly after entering the Straight.  He said after this he pushed WINNER ST PAULâS along in the early part of the Straight, however, as the horse was not responding to his riding and was giving ground and as he had concern over the horseâs action given what had occurred rounding the Home Turn, he eased it down over the final 200 Metres.

N Rawiller (DRAGON) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the 1600 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of HIGH SPEED METRO, causing that horse to clip the heels of DRAGON and blunder when it lost the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  N Rawiller was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 11 December 2014 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 30 November 2014.

When questioned, A Atzeni stated that he had been instructed                                        if possible to obtain a position with cover in midfield or in front of midfield on MIZZEN GREY from an inside draw.  He said in the early stages he rode his mount along to clear GOLD TARTINI to his inside, however, when that horse maintained its position inside MIZZEN GREY, his mount was left racing in a three wide position initially with cover.  He said however that passing the winning post on the first occasion he was left racing without cover outside GOLD TARTINI and that he was unable to position MIZZEN GREY so as to obtain cover.  He added after the 1200 Metres the pace of the race slackened and he did give consideration to allowing his mount to stride forward to obtain a position closer to the rail, however, due to his instructions he felt that using MIZZEN GREY up to go forward at this time may not have been in the horseâs best interests.  He said in hindsight he should have allowed the horse to improve its position rather than continuing to race wide and without cover given the sectionals of the race at the relevant times.  The Stewards advised A Atzeni that, in their opinion, he should have permitted his mount to improve its position at this time rather than covering unnecessary ground.

                The Stewards tonight inquired into the reason for KIROV (S277), which was entered for this race, being inadvertently treated.  It was ascertained that KIROV was inadvertently treated with phenylbutazone when SMART BALL (P277) was intended to be treated with this substance.  Acting on a confirmed phone call from Mr D J Hall, the trainer of KIROV, on Saturday, 22 November 2014, KIROV was withdrawn from the entries prior to declarations for this race.  Evidence was tonight taken from Mr Hall, Mr S T Lee, assistant trainer, Mr K H Chow, head lad, Mr K H Wong, work rider, Dr J May, Houseman, Department of Veterinary Clinical Services, and Dr C M Riggs, Head of Veterinary Clinical Services.  Mr Hall pleaded guilty to a breach of Rule 50(2) for having failed in his responsibility for all matters pertaining to the running of his stable.  Mr Hall was fined the sum of $15,000.  In assessing the appropriate penalty, the Stewards took into consideration KIROV was withdrawn prior to declarations.

When questioned regarding the performance of REBORN TO WIN, M Demuro stated that after enjoying a good run behind the leader ENTRUSTING, his mount was taken back through the field after the 500 Metres which resulted in the horse losing ground.  He said after this REBORN TO WIN appeared to be one-paced as it was then not able to quicken when able to shift out from behind ENTRUSTING.  He added in the early part of the Straight REBORN TO WIN lay in under pressure and failed to close off the race over the final 200 Metres.  He said whilst REBORN TO WIN was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race, he was of the opinion that the circumstances of the race were not favourable to his mount.

Throughout the race, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, D Whyte stated that he had been asked to ride GOLD PRECIOUS in a midfield position or in advance of midfield but with cover if possible from the outside barrier.  He said he had ridden GOLD PRECIOUS in a barrier trial in the lead up to todayâs race and it had performed well when ridden in a midfield position with cover.  He said on jumping he immediately observed that SPARKLING SWORD was being vigorously ridden from barrier 11 and that TRIUMPHANT DRAGON had begun well and after urging GOLD PRECIOUS along for some strides in the early stages, he believed that too much use would have had to be made of GOLD PRECIOUS to obtain a forward position and moreover it then may have been left racing without cover which was an integral part of his instructions.  He said therefore he felt that it was in the best interests of GOLD PRECIOUS to shift it across behind runners and ensure it was able to obtain cover.  He added the horse travelled comfortably in the early stages behind JUN JU, a horse he believed would be a strong chance in the race and which he felt would be able to take him into the race at the required time.
A veterinary inspection of SKY FIRE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SKY FIRE, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SKY FIRE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

U Rispoli (JUN GONG) dropped his whip at the 150 Metres.
Throughout the race, HAPPY AND HEALTHY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, H W Lai stated that he had been asked to obtain a midfield position with cover on PEARL WIN if possible.  He said it was felt that due to the makeup of the field with a number of speedy runners being drawn inside PEARL WIN, if the horse were to be ridden to obtain a forward position as had been the case in the past, there was a likelihood that PEARL WIN would be left racing wide and without cover.  He said with the anticipated early speed it was hoped that the field would break up and that PEARL WIN would be able to obtain a midfield position, however, due to the circumstances of the race in the early stages, he was obliged to settle back further than had been intended to obtain cover as PERCY JACKSON, which was drawn to his immediate inside, initially began well before being steadied in the early stages.
When questioned regarding the performance of BORN IN CHINA, D Whyte stated that it had been intended for BORN IN CHINA to be ridden on the pace as horses ridden in forward positions had appeared to be advantaged by todayâs track, however, he was asked not to ride BORN IN CHINA too vigorously to achieve this.  He said after initially parading satisfactorily, BORN IN CHINA, which was having its first race start in Hong Kong, became fractious behind the barriers and sweated up badly and after being placed in the barriers would not stand still.  He said he initially rode BORN IN CHINA along in the early stages, however, with a number of runners including MARVEL TRIBE and HAPPY AND HEALTHY, which were drawn inside BORN IN CHINA, maintaining their positions, he felt that he would have had to make too much use of the horse to clear those horses and that were BORN IN CHINA to be ridden along to do this, it could have been left racing wide and without cover.  He said he therefore attempted to shift the horse across behind runners in the early stages and obtain a position with cover.  He added BORN IN CHINA initially proved difficult to settle when being steadied, however, he was able to obtain cover behind MARVEL TRIBE near the 800 Metres.  He said after this BORN IN CHINA travelled only fairly and after being shifted to the outside of runners in the early part of the Straight did not finish off the race.  He said whilst BORN IN CHINA was disappointing, the fact that it sweated up badly behind the barriers and then was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended, the horse, in his opinion, did have some excuses.

Whilst the Stewards were satisfied that the riding of M Demuro (HOW SPEEDY), 6th placegetter, over the concluding stages did not affect the horseâs finishing position, he was nonetheless reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts out at least hands and heels to the end of the race where circumstances permit.
When questioned, Mr C W Chang, the trainer of JOYFUL LUCK, stated that the horse was successful in Class 5 three starts ago when leading in a race which was run at a very slow tempo.  He said he had adopted similar tactics in Class 4 on JOYFUL LUCK at its subsequent two starts.  He said on both occasions JOYFUL LUCK had weakened out of the race over the concluding stages and therefore he felt that in this grade and in todayâs race where there appeared to be good speed, he believed it would be in JOYFUL LUCKâs best interests to be ridden in 3rd or 4th position with cover to see if it would be able to finish off the race more strongly and perform better than at its last two starts.  He added he had hoped that JOYFUL LUCK would be able to obtain a position one horse off the fence behind the leaders, however, the circumstances of the race resulted in the horse being further back and wider than had been hoped.  He conceded JOYFUL LUCK had begun well and that it would have been possible for it to go forward in the race, however, it was his intention if at all possible for the horse to be ridden with cover.  Mr Chang was advised that his explanation would be noted but was reminded of the requirement to have horses ridden in a consistent manner where circumstance permit.

He said after this PLANET CHOICE regained its balance and continued to travel strongly, however, approaching the 500 Metres the horse appeared to become uncoordinated in its action, lost balance and shifted out towards the outside running rail, resulting in it losing a considerable amount of ground and momentum.  He said he did not feel any other horse had a bearing on the horseâs racing manners at this time and that PLANET CHOICE had become badly unbalanced of its own doing.  He also stated as he felt that no other horse had galloped on PLANET CHOICE at this time, he was initially concerned that the horse may have broken down and it took a number of strides for him to ascertain whether it was still sound.  He said after the 400 Metres he commenced to push the horse along, however, as PLANET CHOICE was not striding out well, he did not continue to ride it vigorously for the remainder of the race given what had occurred approaching the 500 Metres.  After viewing all the available videos, the Stewards were satisfied that no other horse had any bearing on PLANET CHOICE becoming unbalanced at this time.  A veterinary inspection of PLANET CHOICE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                Shortly after the start, WINNING LEADER was awkwardly placed outside the heels of KHAYA.
Near the 1200 Metres, PLEASURE GAINS shifted out abruptly when over-racing and awkwardly placed behind KHAYA and in doing so took FLAME HERO wider.
Passing the 1200 Metres, KABAYAN was shifted out away from the heels of DIVINE CALLING.
Approaching the 1100 Metres, KABAYAN was checked away from the heels of DIVINE CALLING which was racing tight inside FLAME HERO as U Rispoli, the rider of FLAME HERO, attempted to shift that horse in to obtain cover.
In the early part of the Straight, KHAYA was inclined to lay in under pressure.
When questioned, U Rispoli stated that he had been instructed to ride FLAME HERO behind the leaders with cover if possible.  He said it was felt that PLEASURE GAINS and KHAYA would likely take up leading positions and that he may be able to shift over with those horses in the early stages.  He said unlike when he had ridden FLAME HERO last season, the horse did not show the early speed that was anticipated despite being urged along in the early stages.  He said to obtain the position as instructed, he believed he would have had to ride the horse vigorously and as it was, he slapped it down the shoulder with the whip passing the 1500 Metres in an endeavour to have it travel into a more forward position.  He said when it became apparent to him that he would not be able to obtain the position as instructed, he commenced to shift FLAME HERO across in an endeavour to obtain a midfield position with cover after the 1400 Metres.  He added after FLAME HERO was inconvenienced by PLEASURE GAINS near the 1200 Metres, he attempted to shift FLAME HERO in to race closer to the rail so that it could obtain cover behind PLEASURE GAINS.  He said despite being ridden along at this time, FLAME HERO was not travelling well enough to obtain this position and consequently was obliged to race three wide and without cover for the remainder of the race.
When questioned regarding the performance of DIVINE CALLING, J Moreira stated that he was not under any specific instructions on how to ride the horse as it is well known to him.  He said it was always his intention to remain racing away from the rail so that DIVING CALLING was able to obtain uninterrupted running in the Straight if at all possible.  He said in the early stages PLEASURE GAINS was shifting in and as DIVING CALLING was racing to its inside, he elected to steady his mount to avoid being taken to the rail and consequently he was able to obtain a good trailing position behind PLEASURE GAINS.  He said although DIVINE CALLING raced tight inside FLAME HERO near the 1100 Metres, it was travelling strongly at this time and this was of no concern.  He added DIVINE CALLING continued to travel well and approaching the 400 Metres he shifted the horse out across the heels of WINNING LEADER and obtained clear running at the 400 Metres.  He said DIVINE CALLING initially showed a good turn of foot without being unduly pressured, however, after the 200 Metres he was required to ride it vigorously as the horse was not responding as he anticipated.  He said over the final 200 Metres DIVINE CALLING stayed on only one-paced and although the horse was bumped by KHAYA passing the 50 Metres, this did not have any bearing on DIVINE CALLINGâs finishing position.  He said having in mind that DIVINE CALLING had clear running throughout the Home Straight, the only reason he could offer for the horseâs defeat was the fact that it may not have backed up after its strong first up performance.  A veterinary inspection of DIVINE CALLING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of PLEASURE GAINS immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horseâs trachea.

For the majority of the race, ENSURING and WINNING INSTINCT travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, M Chadwick stated that due to the anticipated slow tempo of the race, he had been asked to obtain a handier position than is usual on TERRIFIC MASTER but not to ride it along aggressively to do so.  He said TERRIFIC MASTER was able to obtain a forward position without having to be aggressively ridden and then travelled well with cover behind the leader HAPPY SUMMER.

Near the 50 Metres, FULL TALENT and ARPINATI raced tight.
W M Lai (FLYING ELITE) was reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts out at least hands and heels all the way to the end of the race, where circumstances permit.
When questioned, U Rispoli stated that, from barrier 14, it was agreed that he should ride ROMANTIC TOUCH positively in the early stages as it as felt that the race would not be run at a fast tempo.  He said it was decided that if ROMANTIC TOUCH were to be ridden towards the rear of the field, as it had been in its only two race starts in Hong Kong, the horse may be left without cover.  He said he was able to shift across to race in the lead without having to make too much use of ROMANTIC TOUCH in the early stages and after obtaining the lead, the horse then travelled comfortably.  He said rounding the Home Turn ROMANTIC TOUCH lay out but in the Straight raced truly and after initially responding well to his riding ROMANTIC TOUCHâs run ended at about the 100 Metres.  He added after the race he recommended to connections to consider dropping the horse back in distance as it was found wanting over the concluding stages.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that as REGENCY KING was dropping back in distance, it was decided he should attempt to obtain a forward position, however, not to pressure the horse unduly in the early stages because were REGENCY KING not be able to lead, this may result in it over-racing.  He said in the early stages REGENCY KING showed good early speed, however, runners drawn wide were ridden to obtain leading positions and he believed he would have had to ride REGENCY KING along to press for a forward position.  He added the pace of the race in the early stage was good and REGENCY KING travelled well.  He said he had hoped to remain racing in a position one horse off the fence to allow REGENCY KING the opportunity to shift out on straightening, however, he was taken to the rail by FULL VALUE in the run to the first turn.  He said at this time the tempo of the race slowed and REGENCY KING proved somewhat difficult to settle, however, the horse was still able to finish off the race well in the Straight.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of VICTORY GENERAL, J Moreira stated that he had to make some use of the horse in the early stages to cross from its wide barrier.  He said after the 900 Metres he was able to shift in to assume the lead on the rail and VICTORY GENERAL then commenced to travel satisfactorily.  He said after the 800 Metres TOMODACHI was allowed to improve its position outside VICTORY GENERAL and rather than becoming engaged in a speed battle with that horse, he elected to allow his mount to settle and shift out to a position one horse off the rail.  He added VICTORY GENERAL came under pressure rounding the Home Turn and immediately came off the bridle.  He said when giving ground in the Straight VICTORY GENERAL got its head up due to its unusual galloping action and then weakened badly in the latter part of the race.  A veterinary inspection of VICTORY GENERAL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of TOMODACHI, Apprentice C Y Lui stated that the horse did not show the same early speed that it had shown when he had previously ridden it.  He said because of this he had to make some use of TOMODACHI in the early stages to take up a forward position as instructed.  He said TOMODACHI travelled only fairly in the early and middle stages and for this reason he allowed his mount to improve after the 800 Metres to see whether it would travel more kindly after being able to lead on the rail.  He added at the entrance to the Straight TOMODACHI gave him a limited response when placed under pressure, however, weakened out of the race over the final 200 Metres and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of TOMODACHI immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, Apprentice C Y Lui (SMART UNION) stated that after he was left racing three wide and without cover passing the winning post on the first occasion, he remained racing outside SPIRIT SOARING which was positioned outside GOOD THINKER.  He said after the 1100 Metres he considered allowing his mount to improve to see if he may be able to obtain a position closer to the rail, however, he felt the race was being run at a steady tempo at this time and had he ridden SMART UNION to improve its position, there was a strong likelihood that both GOOD THINKER and SPIRIT SOARING would also be ridden forward, resulting in SMART UNION having to make a sustained run.  He added therefore he elected to keep SMART UNION balanced and travelling well as he believed that this provided the horse with the best opportunity to finish off its race.

He said after the 900 Metres it appeared to him that GENTILIS was being steadied and rather than fight with YOU ARE THE ONE in an endeavour to remain racing off GENTILIS, he elected to allow the horse to stride forward which resulted in YOU ARE THE ONE gaining a slight advantage over GENTILIS after the 700 Metres.  He added YOU ARE THE ONE came under pressure prior to the Home Turn and then weakened out of the race in the Straight.  He said in hindsight he believed that he should have made an attempt to steady YOU ARE THE ONE rather than racing in advance of GENTILIS.  The Stewards advised Apprentice Lui that although he is an apprentice jockey, given his experience in Hong Kong, he should have shown more judgement at this time and made an attempt to steady YOU ARE THE ONE given the tempo of the race and given that YOU ARE THE ONE was not in a position to cross GENTILIS to his inside.

Z Purton was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 19 January 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The Stewards ruled that this period of suspension is to be served cumulatively with the period of suspension Jockey Purton incurred in Race 9 and as such it will commence on Thursday, 8 January 2015.
HO IN ONE had difficulty obtaining a clear run in the early part of the Straight and passing the 150 Metres was shifted to the inside of WHAT YOU DREAM to obtain clear running.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BEAUTY ONLY, N Callan stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a more forward position given that it had drawn barrier 1 and with an anticipated slow pace.  He said as a number of todayâs races had been won by horses which had raced away from the rail, he was asked to shift BEAUTY ONLY away from the rail and race in a position one horse wide if possible.  He said in accordance with these instructions he rode BEAUTY ONLY along in the early stages to establish a forward position and after the 1200 Metres shifted it out so as not to be left racing on the rail.  He said whilst BEAUTY ONLY raced tight inside ENTHUSIASM for some distance after the 1000 Metres, BEAUTY ONLY was not affected by this contact and travelled comfortably in the early and middle stages.  He added in the early part of the Straight BEAUTY ONLY came under pressure and changed lead leg on a number of occasions.  He said after the 200 Metres BEAUTY ONLY did not respond to his riding and near the 75 Metres shifted out and was awkwardly placed close to the heels of FANTASTIC KAKA.  He said whilst BEAUTY ONLY became unbalanced in this incident, the horse was beaten at that time and this did not have an effect on its final finishing position.  He stated that having in mind the way in which BEAUTY ONLY raced today in comparison with its previous starts in Hong Kong, he believed that the horse did not appreciate being ridden in a more forward position and accordingly he recommended to connections that they ride it more conservatively in future.  A veterinary inspection of BEAUTY ONLY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PACKING LLAREGYB, Z Purton stated that he was able to shift across from a wide barrier to race with cover on the rail in the early stages.  He said PACKING LLAREGYB travelled comfortably and rounding the Home Turn he was able to shift away from the rail into clear running between LOTUS BREEZE and BEAUTY ONLY.  He said however that PACKING LLAREGYB immediately came under pressure and weakened on its run over the final 200 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of PACKING LLAREGYB immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Rounding the Home Turn, PRESIDENT LINCOLN, when racing between PO CHING TREASURE and INDUSTRIALIST WAY, became awkward and struck itself, resulting in it becoming badly unbalanced and losing a significant amount of ground.  When PRESIDENT LINCOLN lost ground abruptly, MALAYAN PEARL and HOLMES LEGEND, both of which were following, were checked in consequence.  The performance of PRESIDENT LINCOLN, which subsequently finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of JUN HUO, B Prebble stated that he was able to obtain a nice position throughout the race behind the leader PO CHING TREASURE.  He said a run inside that horse presented itself rounding the Home Turn when PO CHING TREASURE lay out away from the rail.  He said he rode JUN HUO along and whilst the horse did improve into the run inside PO CHING TREASURE, it did not respond as quickly as thought it would.  He said JUN HUO came under heavy pressure after the 300 Metres, however, despite being ridden along did not respond as it did last start.  He added whilst JUN HUO became unbalanced when bumped on the hindquarters by PO CHING TREASURE near the 150 Metres, JUN HUO was already under pressure at this time and was not responding to his riding.  He did say he had ridden JUN HUO in some of its work in the lead up to todayâs race including when the horse last galloped on 12 December 2014 and based on this good work he expected the horse to run well.  Mr K W Lui, the trainer of JUN HUO, was not able to explain why the horse raced disappointingly other than it was stepping up in distance from 1600 Metres to 1800 Metres which may have been a factor.  A veterinary inspection of JUN HUO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of JUN HUO, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.

He said LANG TAI SING travelled satisfactorily during the middle stages, however, came under pressure rounding the Home Turn and was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding in the Straight.  He did say the fact that he had to ride his mount along in the early stages may have accounted for the horse not finishing off the race, however, he did also suggest to connections that they consider riding it more quietly in the future so that it is able to close off its races.  A veterinary inspection of LANG TAI SING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said HELENâS CHOICE was able to recover lost ground and obtained a midfield position.  He said HELENâS CHOICE travelled well until about the 600 Metres at which time he intended to improve his position as the race at this time was only being steadily run.  He added HELENâS CHOICE immediately came under pressure and then despite being ridden out weakened badly in the Straight.  He said whilst HELENâS CHOICE did not feel lame, the horse appeared to be reluctant to stretch out as it had done when he had ridden it in the past.  Mr K W Lui, the trainer of HELENâS CHOICE, was unable to provide any explanation for the disappointing performance of HELENâS CHOICE other than to say that subsequent races had indicated to him that horses racing back in the field did not appear to be making ground.  He said irrespective of this, HELENâS CHOICE was disappointing in that it was under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn and did not finish off its race.  He added the horse had done well since its last start and had been ridden by Jockey Moreira in some of its work and, in his opinion, this work was good.  He said based on this work, he anticipated that HELENâS CHOICE would perform well.  A veterinary inspection of HELENâS CHOICE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HELENâS CHOICE, a favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.

Throughout the race, DIAMOND FRIENDS travelled wide and without cover.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the prima facie view that an incident occurred approaching the 200 Metres which cast sufficient doubt on whether ALL TIMES LUCKY should be declared the winner of the race.  Subsequently D Whyte, the rider of 2nd placed, MONTE CASTELLO, lodged a protest/objection against ALL TIMES LUCKY being declared the winner alleging interference to his mount approaching the 200 Metres.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, the Stewards found that approaching the 200 Metres MONTE CASTELLO shifted out away from THOR THE GREATEST when that horse shifted out under pressure.  As a result of this movement, MONTE CASTELLO shifted out into a position close to the heels of ALL TIMES LUCKY of its own accord.  At the same time, ALL TIMES LUCKY shifted in marginally.  As the Stewards were of the opinion that the incident had resulted more from MONTE CASTELLO shifting out towards the heels of ALL TIMES LUCKY rather than any discernible shift inwards from ALL TIMES LUCKY, the protest/objection was overruled and weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of ENJOY THE GAME, M Demuro stated that the horse travelled only fairly in the early and middle stages as was the case when he rode it last start.  He said he attempted to ride ENJOY THE GAME in a similar manner tonight as he did last start when successful in that he had attempted to improve its position in the Back Straight.  He said despite being vigorously ridden along during this part of the race, ENJOY THE GAME did not improve its position as it did last start, rather the horse lost ground and then was most disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding at any stage.  He added ENJOY THE GAME did not feel relaxed during the race and because of this he recommended to the connections that they consider experimenting with the gear on ENJOY THE GAME.  Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of ENJOY THE GAME, stated that although the horse had some hard racing at its recent starts, nonetheless it had pleased him in its track work since then.  He said although horses coming from back in the field appeared disadvantaged tonight, nonetheless he still believed that ENJOY THE GAME was disappointing in that it did not improve its position at any stage.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that prior to the race he had a discussion with Mr D E Ferraris, the trainer of AFFLUENCE OF RAIN, regarding how that horse should be ridden in tonightâs race.  He said during this discussion he advised Mr Ferraris of his view that the horse did not appear to respond to being ridden with the whip when he rode it a number of starts ago and that he felt this view was reinforced after he had viewed videos of the horseâs recent races.  He said in the Straight he rode the horse out vigorously hands and heels and it responded well to being ridden this way.  He said he did consider using the whip on AFFLUENCE OF RAIN at about the 100 Metres, but he felt that as the horse was giving its all, he did not feel it would benefit from being struck with the whip and for this reason he continued to ride the horse out vigorously hands and heels to the end of the race.
When questioned, D Whyte stated that, from the outside barrier, he had been asked to attempt to position SEASONS STAR behind the speed if possible.  He said despite being ridden along in the early stages, SEASONS STAR did not show early speed and when STEP FASTER, which was drawn to the inside of SEASONS STAR, was aggressively ridden, it soon became apparent to him that he would not be able to cross that horse.  He said therefore he elected to shift across behind STEP FASTER and attempted to obtain cover behind that horse.  He said however that at this time LAUDABLE VIRTUE, which was racing in a three wide position, obtained the position behind STEP FASTER and he therefore attempted to steady SEASONS STAR further to see if he would be able to obtain cover.  He said due to the circumstances of the race SEASONS STAR was then required to travel wide for the majority of the race and was much further back in the field than had been intended.  A veterinary inspection of SEASONS STAR immediately following the race revealed the horse to have sustained a laceration to the left hind leg.
DISCIPLES TWELVE and GREAT RUN were sent for sampling.
<18/12/2014 Additional Veterinary Report>The Clinical Veterinary Surgeon reported that WONDER CHOICE was found to be lame in its left hind leg on the morning after racing.  Before being allowed to race again, WONDER CHOICE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said after being crowded for room at the start he rode his mount along in the early stages and approaching the first turn near the 1000 Metres was positioned behind DOMINEER.  He said making the turn SUPER JOCKEY shifted out and blundered after striking the heels of BULLISH FRIEND.  He said he allowed SUPER JOCKEY to shift out into a three wide position along the Back Straight and improved its position so as to obtain the position outside the leader GO BABY GO after the 600 Metres.  He said SUPER JOCKEY then travelled comfortably and the horse initially responded to his riding when placed under pressure in the early part of the Straight.  He said however that approaching the 200 Metres SUPER JOCKEY came under heavy pressure and weakened out of the race over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of SUPER JOCKEY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that ACUMEN, which was having its first race start today, was reluctant to proceed to the barriers.  He said it had been envisaged that, from its wide barrier, ACUMEN would be able to follow the eventual winner DIAMOND MASTER.  He said however that in the early stages ACUMEN did not show any speed and, despite being ridden along for the first 200 Metres of the race, ACUMEN lost touch with the majority of the field when out-paced.  He added between the 800 Metres and the 600 Metres he attempted to balance ACUMEN up to see if it would be able to travel more comfortably, however, the horse was still not able to go with the speed of the race and got a long way out of its ground.  He said after the 600 Metres he commenced to ride ACUMEN along again in an endeavour to have it make up lost ground and it was not until passing the 300 Metres that ACUMEN commenced to respond to his riding and finish off its race.  He said prior to the 100 Metres he directed ACUMEN to the outside of DARK CORE which was giving ground, however, ACUMEN was racing greenly and proved reluctant to shift to the outside of that horse and consequently after the 100 Metres he had to shift ACUMEN out abruptly away from the heels of DARK CORE when finishing off the race strongly.  He said in the circumstances ACUMEN closed off the race well and for this reason he recommended to connections that they consider stepping the horse up in distance at its next race start.  N Rawiller was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must ride his mounts in such a manner to ensure that they are not left with too much to do. 
After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that BULL MARCHE had bled from both nostrils.

He said after the 1000 Metres he was able to shift across to race outside WILD BOY.  He said as SNOW SLIDER had previously shown a tendency to over-race and prove difficult to settle, he was reluctant to apply too much restrain to SNOW SLIDER after obtaining a position outside WILD BOY even though this resulted in the race being run at a faster tempo than he had hoped.  He added at this time, given SNOW SLIDERâs previous history, he did not want the horse over-racing and proving difficult to manage by restraining it too aggressively.

When questioned, U Rispoli reported that he had been asked to lead on FOUR FOUR FIVE if possible as the horse had raced well when ridden in this manner at its most recent start which was a significant improvement on its previous form.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode FOUR FOUR FIVE along vigorously in the early stages in an attempt to lead, however, near the 1500 Metres it became apparent to him that ORIENTAL FANTASIA, which was positioned to the outside of FOUR FOUR FIVE, was travelling keenly and that FOUR FOUR FIVE would not be able to continue to contest the lead without him having to make considerable use of the horse.  He said as the tempo of the race at this time was strong, he elected to allow ORIENTAL FANTASIA to assume the lead and he had hoped to then shift to that horseâs outside.  He said by the time it became available to him to shift to the outside of ORIENTAL FANTASIA, HAPPY KAISER was ridden along to the outside FOUR FOUR FIVE which prevented him from shifting the horse out.  He added when this occurred, FOUR FOUR FIVE immediately came off the bridle and then subsequently, despite being ridden along, finished tailed out.  A veterinary inspection of FOUR FOUR FIVE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.

C Y Ho (ORIENTAL FANTASIA) advised that he had been instructed to attempt to lead as the horse had been consistently ridden in a forward position.  He said at no time during the early stages did he have to ride ORIENTAL FANTASTIA along to obtain a forward position as the horse travelled very strongly in the early and middle stages.  He said he attempted to restrain ORIENTAL FANTASIA to steady the tempo as he was aware that the race was being run at a quick tempo.  He said despite his endeavours, ORIENTAL FANTASIA continued to over-race and would not settle with him even after assuming the outright lead near the 1000 Metres.  He added because of the manner in which ORIENTAL FANTASIA travelled in the early and middle stages, the horse was then not able to finish off the race.

                When Mr T McGovern, the Starter, attempted to effect the start, the gates did not open due to the starting mechanism not being released.  As this occurred, the starting bell was triggered with the race timing device initially being activated.  The starting mechanism was reset with all jockeys being advised that this procedure was being undertaken.  When the gates failed to open in the first instance, no horse reacted in a manner that required their removal from the barriers to undergo a veterinary examination.  The Stewards and the Starter will consult with the relevant members of staff to establish the reason for the starting mechanism initially failing to be released.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of TRENDY WORLD, T H So stated that after being ridden along in the early stages, TRENDY WORLD was able to obtain a forward position outside the eventual winner WHY WHY.  He said although todayâs race was run slightly faster than at its only other start in Hong Kong when it was successful, it was not run at a quick tempo and TRENDY WORLD travelled well until the 500 Metres at which time the horse immediately came under heavy pressure to maintain its position.  He said, despite being fully tested, TRENDY WORLD did not respond to his riding and was most disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race.  He said todayâs performance was in stark contrast to its only other start in Hong Kong when the horse was able to win when ridden in the lead.  He said he could find no fault with the horseâs action throughout and after the race.  He further added that he had ridden TRENDY WORLD in most its work in the lead up to todayâs race as he did in the lead up to the horseâs first start and, based on that good work, it was expected that TRENDY WORLD would again race well today.  Mr L Ho, the trainer of TRENDY WORLD, stated that the horse had had an uninterrupted preparation since its first up success and that its track work had been similar to that prior to its first start.  He said the only reason he could identify at this stage for the horseâs disappointing performance was that it was unable to lead on the rail as it did at its last start.  In respect of the horse drifting in the betting market, Mr Ho stated that, based on the horseâs track work, he had advised the owner of his expectation that TRENDY WORLD would perform well again today.  A veterinary inspection of TRENDY WORLD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of TRENDY WORLD was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, TRENDY WORLD will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered whether MASTER MIND had been afforded a fair start.  After taking evidence from Mr T McGovern, the Starter, and after viewing the videos, it was ascertained that as the start was effected, MASTER MIND reared abruptly, getting its right front leg into the adjoining stall.  MASTER MIND consequently took no part in the race.  As the Stewards were of the opinion that MASTER MIND had caused its own problems, they ruled that it had been afforded a fair start and accordingly was deemed to be a runner.

M Chadwick pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 1000 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of FLAGSHIP SHINE, causing that horse to be taken in onto TOUR DE FORCE, resulting in that horse being badly crowded for room and being checked.  M Chadwick was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 22 January 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).

After the 1300 Metres, LITTLE MEN commenced to prove difficult to settle.
Passing the 150 Metres, JOLLY VICTOR was shifted to the outside of LITTLE MEN.
When questioned, U Rispoli (SANTA FE SUN) stated that he was instructed to attempt to shift the horse to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight if possible as it had struck interference at its most recent start when amongst other runners.  He said for this reason he was reluctant to improve his position inside GIANT TREASURE after the 1300 Metres as he did not want to be left racing inside that horse rounding the Home Turn.  He said as GIANT TREASURE was a strong chance in todayâs race, he felt that it was better to position SANTA FE SUN behind that horse so that it could take his mount into the Straight at which time it would be able to immediately shift to the outside of that runner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HELENE HAPPY STAR, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible.  He said HELENE HAPPY STAR began well and, despite him not riding the horse along in the early stages, it immediately travelled into the bridle.  He said for a considerable distance in the early stages he attempted to steady HELENE HAPPY STAR to obtain cover, however, due to the slow pace, the horse proved very difficult to settle, repeatedly got its head up and was inclined to shift out away from runners to its inside.  He said he did consider allowing HELENE HAPPY STAR to stride forward, however, he believed that this would not have been in the best interests of the horse given its racing manner at that time.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing in a three wide position and attempt to have HELENE HAPPY STAR more settled despite requiring the horse to race three wide and without cover throughout the event.  He added that when the tempo of the race quickened, HELENE HAPPY STAR was left flat-footed and then was not able to finish off the race.  He said HELENE HAPPY STARâs failure in todayâs race could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in a slowly run race.

When questioned, K Teetan stated that he had been asked to ride ENSURING, which was having its first race start at Happy Valley tonight, in a position outside the anticipated leader of the race SEMPITERNAL or behind the speed if another runner showed more pace than ENSURING in the early stages.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, with both SEMPITERNAL and MONSIEUR MOGOK showing superior speed, it appeared to him that he would be left racing in a three wide position and therefore he attempted to steady ENSURING near the 1600 Metres and obtain a position with cover behind EXECUTIVE MANDATE.  He said due to the tempo of the race it took him some time to steady ENSURING in an attempt to position his mount behind EXECUTIVE MANDATE which allowed REDWOOD BABY the opportunity to improve its position inside the heels of ENSURING.  He said he was then not able to shift in to a two wide position behind EXECUTIVE MANDATE as to have done so at this time would likely have caused interference to REDWOOD BABY.  He said for this reason he was left racing in a three wide position without cover passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He added although ENSURING was obliged to race wide and without cover in the early and middle stages, it did provide the horse with the opportunity to improve its position when the tempo slackened after the 1000 Metres to race outside the leader SEMPITERNAL near the 800 Metres.

Approaching the 800 Metres, RIBOT LEGACY got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of TANG PALACE.
After the 800 Metres, MIGHTY GAINS was crowded for room between LOVELY NAUGHTY and GOOD YIELD which got its head on the side and shifted out.
Making the first turn near the 700 Metres, GOOD YIELD got it head on the side and hung out badly, resulting in MIGHTY GAINS being severely hampered when taken wide.  GOOD YIELD continued to hang out until after entering the Home Straight, resulting in MIGHTY GAINS being further hampered for some distance.  GOOD YIELD then finished tailed out.  A veterinary inspection of GOOD YIELD immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  As GOOD YIELD had been barred at its most recent start for hanging out, the Stewards ruled that prior to being permitted to race again, GOOD YIELD will be required to pass a series of consecutive official barrier trials around a bend and amongst runners and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Approaching the 300 Metres, SOUTHCHINA COMMAND, when being shifted to the inside of GOOD YIELD which was giving ground, was checked away from the heels of PRECIOUS GEM which shifted out.
The Stewards issued a charge against G Mosse, the rider of 5th placegetter, SLEDGE HAMMER, for a breach of Rule 100(2) in that he failed to ride his mount out all the way to the end of the race to the satisfaction of the Stewards.  The particulars of the charge were that he negligently failed to direct SLEDGE HAMMER to the outside of LOVELY NAUGHTY over the latter stages of the race into clear and uninterrupted running between that horse and CITY POWER, the consequence being that SLEDGE HAMMER was unable to be tested over the concluding stages due to being held up for clear running behind LOVELY NAUGHTY.  G Mosse pleaded not guilty to the charge and asked for Mr C S Shum, the trainer of SLEDGE HAMMER, to be called as a witness.  After considering all the evidence, G Mosse was found guilty of the charge and was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 5 February 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 25 January 2015.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into consideration the nature of the offence and Jockey Mosseâs poor record in respect of breaches of this Rule of Racing.
A veterinary inspection of MIGHTY GAINS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
CITY POWER and LOVELY NAUGHTY were sent for sampling.

                STAR TRACK was withdrawn on 9.1.15 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (lame right fore) and was replaced by Standby Declared Starter HE WAS ME.  Before being allowed to race again, STAR TRACK will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
BEST TANGO proved difficult to load.  Before being allowed to race again, BEST TANGO will be required to perform satisfactorily in a stalls test.
CONFUCIUS SPIRIT shifted out at the start and was checked away from the heels of ELECTRONIC FORTUNE.
Shortly after the start, HE WAS ME raced tight between GERONIMO MEADOW and GOODHEART SUCCESS which shifted in.
Near the 1200 Metres, BERLINI, which was proving difficult to settle, was checked when crowded for room between UNIVERSAL UNION which shifted out and BEST TANGO which improved up inside the heels of SUPREME FLIGHT (M Guyon) and was then taken in by that horse which was also proving difficult to settle.  M Guyon was severely reprimanded and advised that whilst there were some circumstances to his incident, nonetheless he must ensure that he is sufficiently clear of other runners before shifting ground.
Passing the 1200 Metres, GERONIMO MEADOW was crowded for room inside HE WAS ME which, when racing ungenerously, got its head on the side and shifted in despite the efforts of its rider.  Then passing the 1100 Metres, HE WAS ME commenced to prove very difficult to settle and after the 1000 Metres was checked after improving of its own accord to be racing inside the heels of GOODHEART SUCCESS where there was insufficient room, resulting in UNIVERSAL UNION also being severely checked and blundering.
Passing the 1000 Metres, SUPREME FLIGHT proved difficult to settle and was awkwardly placed close to the heels of ELECTRONIC FORTUNE.  Then making the turn after the 900 Metres, SUPREME FLIGHT raced in restricted room between HAPPY AND HEALTHY and FLYING ELITE which shifted in before being directed out to relieve the tightening to SUPREME FLIGHT.
Passing the 200 Metres, HAPPY AND HEALTHY was steadied when disappointed for running between SUPREME FLIGHT and FLYING ELITE, both of which shifted ground when weakening.
BEST TANGO was unable to obtain clear running until near the 150 Metres.  Then over the concluding stages, BEST TANGO raced in restricted room between ELECTRONIC FORTUNE and GERONIMO MEADOW.
For the majority of the race, SUPREME FLIGHT travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, M Guyon stated that he had been asked to ride SUPREME FLIGHT from off the speed.  He said it was explained to him that SUPREME FLIGHT, when leading in its recent races, had not finished off as anticipated and it was hoped that the horse may be able to finish off the race better today with cover.  Mr A T Millard, the trainer of SUPREME FLIGHT, will be interviewed regarding the riding instructions given to Jockey Guyon prior to the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 14 January 2015.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that it had been intended for UNIVERSAL UNION to be ridden in a position in advance of midfield if possible.  He said however that as the start was effected UNIVERSAL UNION began only fairly which resulted in it being further back in the field than had been intended.  He said he rode his mount along in an endeavour to make up lost ground, however, UNIVERSAL UNION, due to the tempo of the race, was caught behind runners which were proving difficult to settle, resulting in the horse having to be severely checked near the 900 Metres.  He added after this incident UNIVERSAL UNION had difficulty regaining balance rounding the turns.  He said he shifted UNIVERSAL UNION to the outside of runners in the Straight and the horse then closed off the race strongly despite the tempo of the race and the incident near the 900 Metres.
When questioned, D Whyte stated that he had been asked to ride BERLINI similarly to its last start when successful.  He said in todayâs race BERLINI proved very difficult to settle in the early stages, however, the horse raced similarly in the past in the early stages.  He said in the past BERLINI had commenced to travel more tractably as its races progressed, however, today after being checked near the 1200 Metres BERLINI would not settle and consequently was unable to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of BERLINI immediately following the race did not show any significant finding, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

                DRAGON ENERGY was crowded for room on jumping between GRASSLAND DRAGON and EXPEDITE which shifted in abruptly.
From wide barriers, HOLY MAC and CULTURAL CITY were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, DRAGON ENERGY was awkwardly placed between GRASSLAND DRAGON and EXPEDITE.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, DANEWIN TIGER got its head up on a number of occasions when being steadied to obtain cover.
At the 900 Metres, CULTURAL CITY was galloped on by the riderless FAIR WIND.  After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that CULTURAL CITY had sustained a wound over the left hind tendon region.

At the entrance to the Straight, COSTA DEL SOL was bumped by HAPPY MOMENTS which shifted out into clear running.
For the majority of the race, PAKISTAN BABY travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered whether FAIR WIND had been afforded a fair start.  Evidence was taken from Jockey D Whyte and Mr T McGovern, the Starter.  After taking evidence from both parties and after viewing the official videos, it was established that as the start was effected, FAIR WIND, which had been standing well, became fractious and sat down behind, resulting in D Whyte being dislodged due to the fractious nature of the horse.  FAIR WIND then exited the barrier stalls riderless.  As the Stewards formed the opinion that FAIR WIND had caused its own difficulties, it was deemed to have been afforded a fair start and accordingly was confirmed as a runner.  Before being allowed to race again, FAIR WIND will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial.
N Rawiller stated that as EN CIVIL had been able to lead without having too much use made of it and was able to set an average tempo in the early stages, he commenced to quicken the pace after the 800 Metres with a view to establishing a margin over the remainder of the field.  He said he felt this was in the horseâs best interests given that it had not been required to run at a strong tempo throughout the first half of the race.
A veterinary inspection of EXPEDITE and PAKISTAN BABY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
HAPPY MOMENTS and DASHING SUPER were sent for sampling.
<12/2/2015  Additional Veterinary Report>EXPEDITE, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer.  He said at that time there were no significant findings.

Passing the 300 Metres, HOW SPEEDY was steadied when racing in restricted room between BOSSIEE and YO-YO DA which shifted to the outside of MODERN FORTUNE into clear running.
Near the 150 Metres, GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS was momentarily awkwardly placed inside the heels of BEAR RAPPER.
K Teetan (SURREAL) was fined the sum of $2,000 for failing to present himself in the Parade Ring by the required time.
When questioned regarding the performance of BOSSIEE, N Callan stated that, in his opinion, the horse was disappointing.  He said unlike last start when BOSSIEE raced without cover but yet was still successful, today it raced with cover behind NEXT JOURNEY until after the 600 Metres.  He said BOSSIEE was inclined to lay out throughout the race when travelling behind NEXT JOURNEY.  He said BOSSIEE initially gave him a good response when placed under pressure in the early part of the Straight, however, after the 300 Metres came under pressure and then finished off the race only one-paced.  A veterinary inspection of BOSSIEE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Approaching the 1000 Metres, SKYROCKETS was awkwardly placed outside the heels of YOU READ MY MIND.
Approaching the 900 Metres, YOU READ MY MIND and KEY WITNESS bumped.  After this, YOU READ MY MIND was left racing wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.  A veterinary inspection of YOU READ MY MIND immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
Approaching the 700 Metres, SKYROCKETS proved difficult to settle and raced close to the heels of YOU READ MY MIND.
For some distance passing the 700 Metres, VICTORIUS commenced to travel keenly and was awkwardly placed behind KEY WITNESS.
CHOICE TREASURE was unable to obtain clear running until near the 300 Metres.
In the Straight, and particularly when giving ground after the 300 Metres, SKYROCKETS got its head on the side and hung in.
When questioned, C Y Ho (IâM IN CHARGE) stated that he had been advised by Mr C Fownes, the horseâs trainer, that it was anticipated that the race would be run at a good tempo and as the horse had drawn wide in barrier 12, he had been asked to ride IâM IN CHARGE quietly and to shift the horse across behind runners in the early stages.  He said it was felt that were IâM IN CHARGE to be ridden for speed as is usual, the horse, due to the make-up of the field, may be left racing wide and without cover and therefore would not be able to finish off the race.  He said after initially proving somewhat difficult to steady in the early stages, IâM IN CHARGE commenced to travel more kindly until approaching the 900 Metres at which time the horse travelled keenly and got its head up on a number of occasions when being checked away from the heels of LET ME GO.  He said after making the turn near the 850 Metres, IâM IN CHARGE then commenced to travel more generously and rounding the Home Turn he endeavoured to shift IâM IN CHARGE to the outside of runners to obtain clear running.  He said however that at this time DYNAMISM was positioned to the outside of IâM IN CHARGE and was still travelling well enough to prevent him from shifting his mount out.  He said therefore he was obliged to take inside runs and was able to improve his position until near the 250 Metres at which stage IâM IN CHARGE, when attempting tight running between YOU READ MY MIND and VICTORIUS, had to be steadied due to VICTORIUS shifting out.  He added he then directed IâM IN CHARGE to the inside of VICTORIUS to improve into tight running between that horse and JAZZY FEELING.  He said this resulted in IâM IN CHARGE being hampered and bumping JAZZY FEELING, causing both horses to become unbalanced.  He said he was then able to obtain clear running between VICTORIUS and JAZZY FEELING approaching the 100 Metres and was able to ride his mount out to the end of the race.

When questioned, M Chadwick stated that he had been asked to ride HEAVENISARACEHORSE quietly from a wide barrier.  He said apart from one occasion, HEAVENISARACEHORSE had generally been disappointing when ridden positively and for this reason he was asked to have the horse relaxed in the early stages and, if possible, make a quick move around the field rounding the Home Turn in the hope that it may be able to respond better when ridden in this manner.  He said in accordance with his instructions he shifted the horse across behind runners in the early stages and then approaching the 500 Metres improved his position around the field.

When questioned, D Whyte stated that, from the outside barrier, it had been intended for HAPPY SUMMER to be ridden in a forward position if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he urged HAPPY SUMMER along in the early stages, however, the horse did not show the anticipated early speed and he was of the belief that he would have had to ride HAPPY SUMMER aggressively for the horse to cross runners to his inside and possibly lead.  He said for this reason he followed PO CHING TREASURE across whilst continuing to allow the horse to stride forward.  He said after the 1400 Metres it remained apparent to him that he would have had to make considerable use of HAPPY SUMMER to cross runners to his inside despite the moderate tempo of the race and therefore he attempted to obtain cover on HAPPY SUMMER.  He added when he was not able to shift in behind runners, HAPPY SUMMER was left racing wide and without cover.  He said he attempted to improve his position after the 600 Metres, however, FLYING UNICORN shifted out to his inside, resulting in HAPPY SUMMER being taken wider.  He said in the Straight HAPPY SUMMER finished off the race one-paced and therefore he recommended to connections that they consider stepping the horse up in distance in its future starts which may allow it to take up a forward position without having to be aggressively ridden.

TRENDIFUL had some difficulty obtaining clear running passing the 200 Metres and then over the concluding stages was awkwardly placed close to the heels of MY LEGEND.
In the Straight, HIT THE BID lay in under pressure.
When questioned, M Demuro (HIT THE BID) stated that, from a wide barrier, he rode his mount along in the early stages to obtain a forward position as instructed.  He said JET SET DRAGON, which was drawn inside HIT THE BID, showed more early speed than his mount and for this reason making the first turn he elected to see if he was able to obtain a position behind that horse as he believed that he would have had to make too much use of HIT THE BID to clear JET SET DRAGON.  He said in the early part of the Back Straight he was not able to shift in behind JET SET DRAGON and was therefore left racing in a three wide position without cover.  He said although the tempo of the race slowed at the 800 Metres, he believed that he would have had to make too much use of HIT THE BID to go forward having in mind that he had ridden the horse along in the early part of the race and HIT THE BID was carrying top weight of 133 lbs.
A veterinary inspection of MY LEGEND and DIAMOND FRIENDS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Throughout the race, DUAL HAPPY travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
When questioned, M Demuro (ONE OF A KIND) stated that passing the 800 Metres he was in a position following LOVING STAR.  He said when that horse made a forward move after the 800 Metres, he attempted to improve with that horse, however, ONE OF A KIND was not travelling well at that time and he was not able to immediately improve his position behind LOVING STAR.  He said he felt that at this time he would have had to ride ONE OF A KIND along in order to follow LOVING STAR and he did not believe this was in the horseâs best interests at this stage of the race.  He said therefore he allowed NAVEL ORANGE to shift out behind LOVING STAR and he elected to continue to follow that horse forward as he believed NAVEL ORANGE would be a good chance in the race.  He added however that ONE OF A KIND came under heavy pressure after the 600 Metres and the horse then took some time to commence to travel better.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of JOLLY GOOD STAR, J Moreira stated that he was not able to offer any excuse for the horseâs performance.  He said he was able to travel outside the leader in what was a slowly run race.  He said however JOLLY GOOD STAR came under pressure after the 600 Metres to hold its position and then was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race in the Straight.

                The Stewards were notified by Dr T S M Wan, Head of Racing Laboratory, that a pre-race urine sample he had analysed earlier today was found to contain the prohibited substance phenylbutazone and its metabolites.  It was subsequently established that the relevant sample was taken from SOUTHERN SPRINGS, a declared runner in this race.  After informing Mr C S Shum, the trainer of SOUTHERN SPRINGS, of the analystâs findings, the Stewards acceded to a request from him to withdraw SOUTHERN SPRINGS from this race.  Accordingly, SOUTHERN SPRINGS was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  Further, urine and blood samples were subsequently taken from SOUTHERN SPRINGS under post-race conditions.  The matter was now adjourned until a date to be fixed.
As the start was effected, MANIPULATION, which was fractious in the stalls, lifted its front feet off the ground and made heavy contact with the outside of its stall, resulting in the horse losing a considerable amount of ground.  Before being allowed to race again, MANIPULATION will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, TOMâS CHARM was steadied away from the heels of SAFARI MAGIC.
Rounding the Home Turn, CHINA DELIGHT was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GENUINE CHAMPION.
After the 300 Metres, TOMâS CHARM was shifted in away from the heels of MANIPULATION to obtain clear running.  Then approaching the 200 Metres, TOMâS CHARM became unbalanced when bumped heavily by MANIPULATION which, when commencing to give ground, got its head on the side and shifted in away from ENDORSING (N Rawiller) before being taken in marginally by that horse.  CHINA DELIGHT, which was racing to the inside of TOMâS CHARM, blundered when being checked in consequence.  N Rawiller was advised that whilst the racing manners of MANIPULATION had initiated the incident by wanting to lay in away from ENDORSING, nonetheless he had permitted his mount to shift in which had also contributed to the incident.  N Rawiller was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground in similar circumstances.
Near the 100 Metres, ENDORSING momentarily raced in restricted room between STAR MAJESTIC and SAFARI MAGIC which shifted out under pressure.

Passing the 100 Metres, ORIENTAL PROSPER and GORGEOUS DEBUT made contact due to both horses shifting ground.  GORGEOUS DEBUT (M Guyon) then shifted out further after becoming unbalanced when bumped on the hindquarters by ORIENTAL PROSPER.

Close to the finishing line, GENTILIS was awkwardly placed close to the heels of ALL WIN BOY.
Throughout the race, SILLY BUDDIES travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that it has been intended for GENTILIS to be ridden in a forward position.  He said he was asked to lead on GENTILIS however, if the pace of the race was strong in the early stages, he should attempt to obtain cover behind the leaders if possible.  He said after being loaded, GENTILIS initially stood well in the barriers, however, just prior to the start being effected, GENTILIS became fractious and as the gates opened was sitting back in its stall which resulted in it lifting its front feet off the ground and being slow to begin.  He said when this happened he believed that to ride GENTILIS forward at that time was not in the horseâs best interests given that it was anticipated that there was going to be good speed in the race from runners drawn more favourably and that had he have pursued a forward position on GENTILIS, he would likely have been left racing wide and without cover.  He said he therefore elected to shift GENTILIS across behind runners and obtain cover with a view to being able to finish off the race.  He added making the first turn near the 1000 Metres GENTILIS commenced to prove difficult to settle and was awkwardly placed close to the heels of FIVE UP HIGH.  He said after this GENTILIS was able to travel more comfortably and making the Home Turn was able to improve its position to be racing behind the eventual winner SUPREME FALCON.  He said however that after being placed under pressure in the Straight, GENTILIS did not finish off its race.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of GENTILIS, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Moreira to obtain a forward position if possible.

Then near the 150 Metres, ASHKIYR, when attempting to be directed to the outside of APPROVE, was again checked when disappointed for running between MR GNOCCHI and APPROVE which shifted out.  N Callan was advised that for the Stewards to sustain a charge of careless riding against a jockey, they must be comfortably satisfied that the horse, which suffered the interference, had fully established running either inside or outside of his mount.  In both these incidents, the Stewards were satisfied that ASHKIYR had not properly established running either to the inside of APPROVE near the 200 Metres and then to the outside of that horse near the 150 Metres and accordingly charges of careless riding were not issued against N Callan in either case.

When questioned, K Teetan stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on ARCHIPPUS if possible.  He said it was explained to him that with the horseâs light weight and in what appeared to be a race that would be run at a slow tempo, this provided the opportunity for ARCHIPPUS to obtain a forward position which would be more preferable than racing towards the rear of the field in a slowly run race.  He said it was also felt by connections that horses racing on the speed to that stage of the meeting had been advantaged.  He said it was hoped that ARCHIPPUS may be able to obtain a position behind the leaders if possible with cover.  He said after riding his mount along for a short distance after the start, ARCHIPPUS was able to obtain a forward position without too much use having to be made of the horse.  He added when there were a number of runners positioned to the inside of ARCHIPPUS after the 1600 Metres, he allowed the horse to continue on into the lead as it was not possible at this time to obtain a position with cover as instructed.

When questioned, C Y Ho (KIROV) stated that rounding the Home Turn he anticipated that LITTLE DRAGON would shift out which would allow his mount to improve between that horse and EXPECTATOR.  He said however that LITTLE DRAGON shifted out marginally and as he attempted to improve to that horseâs inside, LITTLE DRAGON then shifted back in which resulted in KIROV being held up for clear running until prior to the 200 Metres.
When questioned, N Callan stated that he had been asked to ride LITTLE DRAGON in a forward position from the outside barrier.  He said he had to ride his mount aggressively in the early stages to take up a forward position and passing the 1300 Metres was left racing in a three wide position without cover.  He said he had hoped that he might be able to obtain a position behind KIROV and in front of HO IN ONE, however, when HO IN ONE maintained its position inside LITTLE DRAGON, he was required to allow his mount to stride forward after the 1000 Metres to obtain the position outside the leader TWIN DELIGHT which he was able to do approaching the 700 Metres.  He said because of the amount of use he had to make of LITTLE DRAGON in the early and middle stages, the horse then was not able to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of LITTLE DRAGON immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
TWIN DELIGHT and EXPECTATOR were sent for sampling.

When questioned regarding the performance of REGENCY KING, B Prebble stated that he had to make some use of the horse in the early stages to obtain its customary forward position.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion REGENCY KING had pressure applied to it by FULL TALENT and then after being crossed by that horse near the 1300 Metres the horse was inclined to travel strongly and would not relax.  He said although REGENCY KING weakened in the latter stages of the race, he felt that this was due to the amount of work the horse had to do in the early stages and because of this he felt that its run was not as disappointing as it first appeared.  A veterinary inspection of REGENCY KING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, an endoscopic examination was not able to be conducted on the horse due to being fractious.

He said after this REAL FIT continued to race off the bridle, however, in his opinion, the concerning aspect of REAL FITâs run today was the way that it weakened badly out of the race over the final 200 Metres which gave him the indication that REAL FIT may have been suffering from an internal issue as he was not able to detect any obvious lameness with the horse.  A veterinary inspection of REAL FIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of REAL FIT was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, REAL FIT will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

After the 200 Metres, H W Lai (SMART DECLARATION) dropped his whip.
When questioned regarding his riding of SUPER TALENT, M Demuro stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in about a midfield position with cover if possible from barrier 8.  He said after beginning fairly, he allowed SUPER TALENT the opportunity to obtain a forward position by urging it along in the early stages, however, passing the 1100 Metres he was left racing in a four wide position outside SHINING CHAMPION.  He said as he had been asked to ensure he obtained cover on SUPER TALENT, he elected to steady his mount and shift in behind SHINING CHAMPION and MI SAVVY BOY to obtain cover which resulted in the horse racing further back in the field than had been intended.  He said in the early and middle stages SUPER TALENT raced with an awkward head carriage and had not travelled as kindly as he had hoped.  He said after the 800 Metres he had to ride his mount along in an endeavour to ensure that it was able to maintain its position behind MI SAVVY BOY and LANSBURY.  He said rather than to come wide and cover unnecessary ground rounding the Home Turn, he elected to ride SUPER TALENT towards the inside and after the 500 Metres considered improving his position on SUPER TALENT between LANSBURY and NATURAL FRIENDSHIP, however, as he felt that LANSBURY was travelling quite well at this time, he elected to shift out behind that horse and inside MI SAVVY BOY after the 400 Metres as he did not want to get caught in a pocket inside LANSBURY and behind SHINING CHAMPION.  He added it took some time for SUPER TALENT to be able to shift to the outside of LANSBURY which he was able to do at about the 300 Metres.  He said when able to obtain clear running on the outside of runners in the Straight, SUPER TALENT closed off the race strongly.  He said whilst SUPER TALENT raced further back in the field than had been intended, he believed this was due to the circumstances of the race in the early stages and the fact that to obtain cover and not race wide meant that he had to shift SUPER TALENT across behind runners shortly after the start.  Mr T P Yung, the trainer of SUPER TALENT, advised the Stewards that he had instructed Jockey Demuro to obtain a midfield position if possible and he had stressed to him the preference to obtain cover if at all possible.  He said having in mind that he had placed a particular emphasis on the need to obtain cover, he was satisfied with the manner in which Jockey Demuro had ridden SUPER TALENT.  M Demuro was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must ensure that he rides his mounts in a manner so as not to leave them with too much work to do in their races.
Z Purton was unable to offer any excuse for the disappointing performance of GENTILIS.  He said the horse travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages, however, its run today indicated that it now may prefer racing at Happy Valley.

For the majority of the race, ARCHERâS BOW travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
When questioned, Apprentice K C Ng stated that he had been asked to ride GOLDEN OSMANTHUS more conservatively from barrier 10 as it was anticipated that tonightâs race would be run at a strong tempo as there were a number of horses engaged that had previously taken up forward positions in their races.
Z Purton (MOBILE KING) advised that after being instructed to obtain a forward position, he had to make considerable use of the horse in the early stages to clear runners to his inside.  He said he attempted to steady the tempo of the race in the middle stages having in mind the work that MOBILE KING had had to do in the early part of the race, however, it was taken on in the lead after the 800 Metres when both CASA JUNIOR and ARCHERâS BOW improved to his outside.  He added after MOBILE KING was momentarily crowded for room at the 500 Metres, the horse then came off the bridle and weakened out of the race.  A veterinary inspection of MOBILE KING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.  The performance of MOBILE KING, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MOBILE KING will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Then passing the 200 Metres, JOLLY POSH was checked when crowded for room between GIDDY GIDDY which shifted to the outside of FABULOUS ONE and GALLANT ROCK which shifted in when giving ground.  N Rawiller was advised that he was given the benefit of the doubt in respect of the influence on this incident from GALLANT ROCK shifting in when tiring.  Whilst the Stewards accepted that prior to GALLANT ROCK shifting ground there was an opportunity for GIDDY GIDDY to shift JOLLY POSH out and for both horses to improve between FABULOUS ONE and GALLANT ROCK, nonetheless he was severely reprimanded and advised to exercise due care when shifting his mounts to improve into tight running.
Near the 150 Metres, GOLDEN CHOPSTICKS was shifted out away from the heels of JOLLY POSH and then a short distance later was awkwardly placed outside the heels of GALLANT ROCK which was giving ground.

From the outside barriers, LIGHTNING AND GOLD and HEROIC GURU were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
When being ridden along in the early stages to take up a forward position, DASHING SUPER got its head on the side and lay in, resulting in PERFECT HEDGE and DASHING SUPER racing tight for some distance approaching and passing the winning post on the first occasion.

Also over the concluding stages, GOOD METHOD was held up for clear running behind GRACEFUL KINGDOM after attempting to obtain tight running inside that horse.  Because of this, GOOD METHOD was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
When questioned regarding his riding in the early part of the Straight, M Demuro (OWNERSâ GLORY) stated that at the entrance to the Straight he was positioned behind DASHING SUPER albeit some lengths behind that horse.  He said as the rider of DASHING SUPER had the whip in the right hand and as DASHING SUPER was also racing to the outside of ELEGANCE KLAMMER which appeared to be travelling well, he anticipated that either DASHING SUPER may shift out of its own accord or may be taken out by ELEGANCE KLAMMER and therefore he elected to shift OWNERSâ GLORY to the inside of DASHING SUPER to follow ELEGANCE KLAMMER through.  He said whilst he was aware that a run was available to the outside of DASHING SUPER at this time, due to the possibility that the horse may shift out, he felt his best option at the time was to follow ELEGANCE KLAMMER through as that horse was travelling well.  He added that, in retrospect, he had erred in taking this option as OWNERSâ GLORY was then held up for clear running for a short distance when improving into tight running between HEROIC GURU and DASHING SUPER.  M Demuro was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, in the opinion of the Stewards, he had erred in not improving OWNERSâ GLORY to the outside of DASHING SUPER and inside PERFECT HEDGE.  M Demuro was advised to ensure that he avails himself of clear and uninterrupted running wherever circumstances permit.
When questioned regarding the performance of DASHING SUPER, M Guyon stated that he had to make use of the horse in the early stages to obtain a forward position and was then required to race three wide and without cover until near the 900 Metres at which time the horse was able to shift in to race outside the lead.

When questioned regarding his riding of SICHUAN EXEC, K Teetan stated that from the outside barrier he had been asked to ride the horse positively in the early stages due to its light weight.  He said it was anticipated that BULLISH BOY and SUNNY YING would take up forward positions and he should attempt to obtain a position behind these runners if possible, however, if either one of those horses did not go forward as anticipated, then he should not hesitate in allowing his mount to race either outside or in the lead.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode SICHUAN EXEC positively in the early stages and when SUNNY YING did not show sufficient early speed, he rode his mount forward so as to sit outside BULLISH BOY in the lead passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion he believed that BULLISH BOY was not being ridden to hold the lead and therefore he allowed his mount to improve with a view to possibly crossing to lead on the rail.  He added when BULLISH BOY continued to race to his inside, he allowed SICHUAN EXEC to race to that horseâs outside as he did not want to fight the horse and restrain it unduly even though he was aware that the race was being run at a fast tempo.  K Teetan was reprimanded and advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, his ride on this occasion lacked judgement and that he should endeavour to rate his mounts so that they are able to finish off their races as best as possible under the circumstances.

When questioned, M Guyon (CLUB LIFE) stated that he had been instructed to try and lead if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages, however, FAT CHOY HONG KONG clearly showed more speed than CLUB LIFE in the early stages and he was unable to prevent that horse from crossing CLUB LIFE.  He said after being crossed by FAT CHOY HONG KONG, he then noted that CONTENTMENT was improving its position in the early stages from a wide barrier.  He said he felt at this stage he would have had to make too much use of CLUB LIFE to lead and therefore elected to allow CONTENTMENT to cross.  He said after the 1100 Metres when CHATER DREAM was being aggressively ridden forward, he also allowed that horse to cross CLUB LIFE which provided his mount with cover.  He said although CLUB LIFE was not able to lead, he felt that after the horse had not shown the anticipated early speed, he believed it was in the best interests of the horse to be ridden in this manner rather than make too much use of it which may have negatively impacted on the horseâs ability to finish off the race.
When questioned regarding his riding of CONTENTMENT in the early part of the Straight, N Rawiller stated that after being afforded an easy lead, the horse quickened naturally after the 500 Metres and at the entrance to the Straight.  He said CONTENTMENT had previously shown an immediate turn of foot when placed under pressure when he had ridden the horse in the past, therefore he did not believe that there was a need to place it under heavy pressure in the early stages of the Straight as CONTENTMENT was travelling nicely.  He said passing the 350 Metres he was aware that REDKIRK WARRIOR was improving its position towards the middle of the track and he commenced to slap the horse down the shoulder with his whip in the right hand.  He said when REDKIRK WARRIOR had improved its position to be not quite on terms with CONTENTMENT near the 300 Metres, he commenced to ride his mount along vigorously and CONTENTMENT quickened well as evidenced by the fact that the horse immediately established a margin over the remainder of the field.  He said despite CONTENTMENT being placed under pressure, REDKIRK WARRIOR showed a better turn of foot than CONTENTMENT and, despite him riding CONTENTMENT along, REDKIRK WARRIOR was able to gain an advantage over CONTENTMENT.  He added he placed CONTENTMENT under considerable pressure including using the whip on the horse in the Straight and although CONTENTMENT was inclined to lay out under pressure, it did not take any ground off REDKIRK WARRIOR in the run to the line.  N Rawiller was advised that whilst the Stewards were comfortably satisfied that his riding of CONTENTMENT in the early part of the Straight had not had any bearing on the finishing positions between REDKIRK WARRIOR and CONTENTMENT at the end of the race having in mind that he had ridden CONTENTMENT over the final 300 Metres of the race, he must place his mounts under the necessary degree of pressure at the appropriate time of a race to ensure that his riding is not subject to query and to enable his mounts are afforded every opportunity to finish in the best possible position.
REDKIRK WARRIOR lost its right front plate after passing the winning post.

Over the concluding stages, RAY OF GOLD and DIAMOND MASTER raced tight.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered if DO YOU GET IT had been afforded a fair start.  Evidence was taken from Jockey D Whyte and the Starter, Mr T McGovern.  After viewing the official videos, it was established that as the start was effected, DO YOU GET IT became fractious and reared, resulting in the horse losing a considerable amount of ground.  As the Stewards were satisfied that DO YOU GET IT had caused its own issues, it was deemed to have been afforded a fair start and accordingly was ruled to be a runner.  Before being allowed to race again, DO YOU GET IT will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial.
When questioned, M Guyon stated that he had been asked to ride DIAMOND MASTER in a similar manner to that when it was ridden at its most recent start when successful, that was to obtain cover in about 4th or 5th position if possible.  He said however that from barrier 2, he had some difficulty in steadying DIAMOND MASTER in the early stages and the horse got its head up on a number of occasions and proved difficult to settle.  He said he had hoped to obtain a position with cover behind the eventual winner ELITE SPIRIT, however, due to the manner in which DIAMOND MASTER was racing, he was not able to obtain that position and was left racing inside and behind that horse throughout the race.  He added that, in his opinion, todayâs disappointing performance could be attributed to the fact that DIAMOND MASTER had been obliged to race without cover from an inside draw.  A veterinary inspection of DIAMOND MASTER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Passing the 50 Metres, TELECOM BOSS was bumped by BEAR RAPPER which shifted out in an endeavour to improve outside MULTIMAX.  Then close to the finishing line, TELECOM BOSS was steadied when crowded for room between YO-YO DA and BEAR RAPPER which, after shifting out into tight running between TELECOM BOSS and MULTIMAX, was then taken out by that horse which shifted slight ground.  As the Stewards were satisfied that there was no rider error involved in this incident, no further action was taken.
Over the concluding stages, SENSATION was steadied when disappointed for running between YO-YO DA and SIROCCO TOO and consequently was not able to be ridden all the way to the end of the race.
When questioned, B Prebble (BEAR RAPPER) stated that, from barrier 12, it had been decided to shift his mount across behind runners to avoid covering unnecessary ground.  He said near the 700 Metres he was following THUNDERSTROKE in a three wide position as he had considered shifting BEAR RAPPER to the outside of runners rounding the Home Turn.  He said however that he noticed WINNER ST PAULâS and THUNDERSTROKE both to be racing ungenerously and covering ground, therefore he felt that it was in BEAR RAPPERâs best interests to save ground on that horse and for this reason he shifted the horse in at about the 600 Metres and was able to improve between runners rounding the Home Turn.  He said in the early part of the Straight he was following SENSATION and he intended to follow that horse into the race as SENSATION was one of the obvious main chances in the race.  He said when that horse then did not improve quickly enough after the 300 Metres, he elected to shift his mount in away from the heels of SENSATION to obtain clear running.

After being loaded, GOOD LUCK BOY and SPEEDY SANDY became fractious and reared.  Before being allowed to race again, GOOD LUCK BOY and SPEEDY SANDY will be required to perform satisfactorily in a stalls test.
ASIA RISING shifted out at the start and bumped GORGEOUS LEGEND which was then crowded for room inside MY LITTLE FRIEND which became badly unbalanced after being bumped by that horse.  A short distance later, ASIA RISING was steadied after racing in restricted room between GORGEOUS LEGEND and JETWINGS which shifted out.
GOLDEN GLORY began very awkwardly and shifted out abruptly, resulting in HAPPY METEOR losing ground when crowded for room inside GOOD LUCK BOY which became unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by HAPPY METEOR.
Approaching the 50 Metres, HAPPY METEOR was steadied away from the heels of MY LITTLE FRIEND which shifted in under pressure.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that MY LITTLE FRIEND got somewhat further out of its ground in the early stages than he had hoped due to the fast tempo of the race.  He said as MY LITTLE FRIEND has well-advertised breathing problems he was reluctant to place his mount under extreme pressure in the early stages.  He said it was also hoped to get as close to the outside rail as possible due to horses being advantaged in this part of the track.  He said it was for these reasons that he did not commence to aggressively ride his mount along until near the 300 Metres as he felt that this was the best way to ride MY LITTLE FRIEND to ensure that it was able to close off the race.  N Rawiller was advised to ensure that he does not leave his mounts with too much to do in their races.

For the majority of the race, TOUR DE FORCE travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of DOMINEER, B Prebble stated that his mount travelled strongly in the early and middle stages and he expected it to quicken once placed under pressure near the 400 Metres.  He said however when he commenced to ride DOMINEER along, the horse did not respond to his riding, got its head on the side and was inclined to lay in.  He said, despite being placed under pressure, DOMINEER gave ground and was disappointing.  He added DOMINEERâs action felt normal and he was not able to detect any soundness issues which may have explained todayâs performance.  Trainer C Fownes stated that he was unable to offer any explanation for the performance of DOMINEER as the horse had pleased him in the lead up to the race and a forward showing was anticipated.  He said, at this stage, it is his intention to give DOMINEER a break in order to freshen it up.

DA VINCI was held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight.
When questioned, M Demuro (BOSSIEE) stated that in the early part of the Straight he was held up for clear running behind DASHING CERAMIBO, SILLY BUDDIES and CLEVER BEAVER.  He said near the 350 Metres he shifted his mount out from behind DASHING CERAMIBO to follow SILLY BUDDIES so that he was able to improve either inside or outside of that horse if a run developed.  He said approaching the 300 Metres CLEVER BEAVER shifted out slightly which commenced to present a tight run between that horse and SILLY BUDDIES.  He said he immediately commenced to ride his mount along to improve into this run, however, BOSSIEE got its head on the side, lay in and was reluctant to shift out.  He said for this reason he changed his whip from his left hand into his right hand in an endeavour to encourage BOSSIEE to shift out into the run which was available.  He said he rode his mount along vigorously to have it improve into the run, however, the horse continued to lay in and it was not until near the 150 Metres that he was able to shift it out from behind SILLY BUDDIES to improve between that horse and CLEVER BEAVER.  He added he then commenced to ride his mount along, however, near the 100 Metres BOSSIEE shifted out and became unbalanced after bumping CLEVER BEAVER.  He said he had ridden BOSSIEE hard to improve between SILLY BUDDIES and CLEVER BEAVER early in the Straight, however, the horseâs racing manners were the reason for it not being able to improve into clear running prior to the 150 Metres.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that, from barrier 12, he was asked to ride SIGHT SEEING more conservatively and hopefully to obtain a position in midfield with cover.  He said it was felt that due to the make-up of the field, too much use would have to be made of SIGHT SEEING in the early stages in order to take up a forward position and that there was a possibility that SIGHT SEEING would be left racing wide and without cover.  He said passing the 1000 Metres he was left racing in a four wide position outside TONYBOY, therefore he elected to further steady his mount and obtain a position with cover behind that horse which resulted in SIGHT SEEING racing slightly further back in the field than had been intended.  He said SIGHT SEEING travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages and when the pace quickened after the 500 Metres, the horse commenced to work its way into the race.  He added however that shortly after entering the Straight SIGHT SEEING came under pressure and was disappointing in the manner in which it closed off the race.  A veterinary inspection of SIGHT SEEING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on TONYBOY at the request of Trainer A T Millard.  The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.

When questioned, J Moreira stated that although HELENâS CHOICE travelled wide and without cover throughout the race, nonetheless the horse was disappointing in the manner in which it failed to stretch out over the final 200 Metre.  He said whilst he was not able to detect whether the horse was sore or not, nonetheless he felt that HELENâS CHOICE did not feel comfortable in its action in the latter stages of the race.

After the 900 Metres, MONTE CASTELLO proved very difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed behind CAGA FORCE.
When questioned, D Whyte stated that he had been asked to ride REGENCY HO HO positively in the early stages from a wide barrier as it was anticipated that the race would not be run at a fast tempo and it was also felt that horses racing in forward positions had been more advantaged in the races conducted to this point of the programme.  He said after beginning well, REGENCY HO HO raced tight outside STRONG FOUNDATION in the early stages after which he was able to commence riding the horse along in order to improve his position.  He said making the first turn he was left racing in a three wide position outside CAGA FORCE and he felt that he would have had to make too much use of REGENCY HO HO to endeavour to clear that horse and consequently REGENCY HO HO was left racing in a position three wide and without cover throughout the race.
A veterinary inspection of MONTE CASTELLO immediately following the race revealed the horse to have bled from both nostrils.

When questioned regarding the performance of TOP ACT, M Guyon stated that he had been asked by Mr A T Millard, the trainer of TOP ACT, to ride the horse behind the speed with cover if possible.  He said it was explained to him that racing forward of midfield was generally a more preferable position on tonightâs track and that, from barrier 7, it may have been possible to obtain this position in the early stages.  He said however that due to the composition of the field in the early stages, he was left racing in a three wide position and without cover after the 1200 Metres.  He said TOP ACT travelled only fairly and came under pressure prior to the Home Turn and in the Straight gave ground.  He said although TOP ACT raced wide at its last start when successful, the horse had cover for the majority of that race and was able to then show a turn of foot when ridden in about a midfield position.  He added, judging by the way that TOP ACT weakened tonight, he was of the opinion that the horse is best suited when ridden more conservatively.  A veterinary inspection of TOP ACT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of TOP ACT, a favourite for tonightâs race and a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, TOP ACT will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

GOOD SMILE began awkwardly and shifted out abruptly, resulting in SEA FURY being hampered.  After this, SEA FURY, from a wide barrier, was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Rounding the first turn, SNOW SLIDER hung out badly, ran to the outside rail and was subsequently retired from the event.  A veterinary inspection of SNOW SLIDER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  Trainer P F Yiu was advised that as this was the second occasion on which SNOW SLIDER had incurred an embargo for hanging out in a race, the horse must barrier trial satisfactorily on at least three consecutive occasions around a bend prior to being permitted to race again.  Mr Yiu advised that he would speak to the connections of SNOW SLIDER regarding the horseâs immediate racing future.
When questioned regarding his riding in the early stages, Y T Cheng (XI YING MEN) stated that, from the outside barrier, he had been instructed to ride his mount positively in the early stages and obtain the lead if possible.  He said he was advised to ensure that he held his mount rounding the turns as XI YING MEN had previously shown an inclination to hang out in its races around a bend.  He said in accordance with the instructions, he rode XI YING MEN aggressively in the early stages in an endeavour to lead.  He said after the 1000 Metres it became apparent to him that he would not be able to clear MIGHTY GAINS and ALWAYS WONDERFUL to his inside.  He said he continued to push XI YING MEN, however, did not ride it with the same intensity that he had in the early stages.  He added near the 800 Metres he attempted to steady XI YING MEN and sit off ALWAYS WONDERFUL in a position without cover as the turn was approaching.  He said whilst he was aware that the tempo of the race in the early stages was quick, he felt obliged to make every endeavour to lead on XI YING MEN given the instructions he had received.  Y T Cheng was advised that whilst the Stewards acknowledged that XI YING MEN assumes a forward position in its races and that his riding of the horse in the initial stages was completely reasonable, nonetheless his riding after the 1000 Metres, when it was apparent that XI YING MEN was not showing sufficient speed to cross MIGHTY GAINS and ALWAYS WONDERFUL, lacked the necessary degree of judgement expected of a rider in Hong Kong.  He was also advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have made an effort to come back on XI YING MEN rather than continue to ride his mount along which may have had the effect of lessening the tempo of the race and providing XI YING MEN with more of an opportunity to finish off its race.
After the race, Z Purton stated that due to the fast tempo in the early stages, MIGHTY GAINS was not able to finish off its race in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of MIGHTY GAINS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
Also after the race, K C Leung stated that whilst the tempo of the race in the early stages was quick, nonetheless ALWAYS WONDERFUL travelled well.  He said after being passed by XI YING MEN near the 300 Metres, ALWAYS WONDERFUL commenced to give ground and then did not feel comfortable in its action over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of ALWAYS WONDERFUL immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.

When questioned regarding his riding of WHAT YOU DREAM, N Rawiller stated that he had been instructed to ride the horse in a midfield position if possible from its good barrier draw.  He said on jumping WHAT YOU DREAM was crowded for room between runners which resulted in it being awkwardly placed close to the heels of TRUMP to its inside.  He said because of this WHAT YOU DREAM took a number of strides to get balanced and was required to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He said after the 1300 Metres he slapped his mount down the shoulder with the whip in an endeavour to have it improve its position and be closer to midfield if possible, however, WHAT YOU DREAM did not show any early speed.  He said the pace of the race after the 900 Metres quickened appreciably and WHAT YOU DREAM was always off the bridle chasing and was not able to balance up at any stage.  He said after the 600 Metres he was niggling at WHAT YOU DREAM in an endeavour to have the horse improve its position and slapped the horse down the shoulder on a number of occasions with the whip as he was aware that he was further back in the field than had been intended, however, at this time the pace of the race remained very fast and, despite being ridden along, WHAT YOU DREAM was not able to make up any ground until rounding the Home Turn.  He added he placed WHAT YOU DREAM under heavy pressure at the entrance to the Straight and commenced to use the whip on the horse at the 300 Metres after which WHAT YOU DREAM closed off the race well.  N Rawiller was advised that notwithstanding that WHAT YOU DREAM had been hampered at the start and that the pace of the race in the middle stages was strong, nonetheless the Stewards had concerns with the manner in which WHAT YOU DREAM was ridden in todayâs race.  He was also advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in a manner so as to ensure that they do not get too far out of their ground and are not left with too much to do.  He was advised that his riding of WHAT YOU DREAM in this race had come under notice and he must ride his mounts in such a manner so as to ensure that there is no room for query.

SUGAR was promoted from Reserve No. 3 to Reserve No. 2 on Wednesday, 4 February 2015 following the withdrawal of a horse from the field.  Mr Schutz pleaded guilty to a breach of Rule 50(2) in that as the person responsible for all matters pertaining to the running of his stable, he negligently permitted SUGAR to be treated on Thursday, 5 February 2015 when that horse had previously been promoted to Standby Declared Starter No. 2 in this race.

When questioned, M Guyon stated that as he had been advised that OUR HONOUR had not finished off its races when pressured in the early stages, he was asked to ride the horse in about a midfield position or slightly worse if possible.  He said for this reason after the 900 Metres he did not improve his position to prevent FOTOGENIC from shifting ground in front of OUR HONOUR as he felt that he would have had to ride it along at this time to do so which, having in mind his instructions, would not have been in the horseâs best interests.
When questioned, U Rispoli stated that he had been instructed to lead on YOU ARE THE ONE if possible.  He said making the turn into the Back Straight after the 900 Metres there were a number of horses positioned to the outside of YOU ARE THE ONE being ridden to take up forward positions including JOYEUX which he knew to be lightly weighted as comparison to YOU ARE THE ONE which was carrying top weight.  He said as the tempo of the race along the Back Straight was good, he did not want to become engaged in a speed battle with JOYEUX and therefore allowed that horse to cross YOU ARE THE ONE after the 700 Metres.  He said he was of the opinion at the time that had he have ridden YOU ARE THE ONE to maintain the lead, the horse may not have been able to close off its race, nonetheless it was disappointing as it failed to quicken in the Straight and compounded.

He said then when the gates were released GRIFFINDOR began only fairly.

When questioned, M Demuro stated that he had been asked to ride ANDNOWURMINE positively in the early stages as the horse was stepping up in distance to the 1400 Metres of todayâs race.  He said he had hoped to obtain cover on ANDNOWURMINE as the horse had raced well at its last start when ridden in this manner.  He said due to the circumstances of the race in the early stages he was left racing wide outside MASQUERADER.  He said although ANDNOWURMINE was obliged to race three wide without cover after the 1000 Metres, he felt that the tempo of the race at this time was fair and therefore he was reluctant to pressure ANDNOWURMINE to improve its position in the hope of racing closer to the rail.  He said the tempo of the race steadied up somewhat after the 800 Metres, however, ANDNOWURMINE was travelling well at this time.  He said however that ANDNOWURMINE came under pressure after the 500 Metres and did not respond as well as it did at its last start.  He added, despite being placed under pressure, ANDNOWURMINE weakened noticeably in the Straight and, in his opinion, the horse was reluctant to fully stretch out.  He said after the race he was not able to detect any specific soundness issue with ANDNOWURMINE, however, the manner in which the horse weakened in the Straight was most concerning.  A veterinary inspection of ANDNOWURMINE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of ANDNOWURMINE was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, ANDNOWURMINE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said KING TAI SING continued to lay out when racing three wide and without cover before coming under pressure as far out as the 600 Metres.  He said whilst KING TAI SING continued to lay out rounding the Home Turn and raced ungenerously in the Straight, nonetheless the horse was disappointing in that it was beaten as far out as the 600 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of KING TAI SING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of KING TAI SING was considered unacceptable.

When questioned regarding his riding of BEAR HERO, M Demuro stated that he was asked to ride the horse in the same manner as he did at its most recent start when it finished off the race strongly to run third.  He said in the early stages he rode the horse quietly as it had previously been explained to him that BEAR HERO can over-race if pushed along in the early stages.  He said as he did not want to be taken across towards the rail, he allowed LANG TAI SING to improve its position ahead of BEAR HERO making the turn after the 900 Metres as that horse was shifting in and BEAR HERO was positioned initially to its inside.  He added rounding the Home Turn and at the entrance to the Straight he shifted BEAR HERO out to follow LANG TAI SING, however, BEAR HERO took some time to become balanced.  He said he was able to shift BEAR HERO to the outside of LANG TAI SING approaching the 300 Metres, however, BEAR HERO did not close off the race as strongly today as it did at its most recent start.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that he had been asked to ride GOLDEN DEER in about a midfield position if possible.  He said in the early stages he attempted to shift across behind IâM IN CHARGE and obtain a position with cover behind that horse, however, due to the circumstances of the race in the early stages, runners from towards the rear of the field were able to improve their positions and this resulted in JAZZY FEELING being able to obtain the position behind IâM IN CHARGE which resulted in GOLDEN DEER being obliged to race three wide and without cover for the majority of the race.

When questioned, J Moreira (NAVEL ORANGE) stated that near the 900 Metres he shifted out into a three wide position and commenced to improve his position in the hope that a runner in advance of NAVEL ORANGE would make a forward move so that he would be able to trail that horse into the race.  He said NAVEL ORANGE took some time to gather momentum and after the 800 Metres he was positioned to the outside of HAPPY CENTENARY which shifted out into a three wide position which resulted in NAVEL ORANGE being left racing in a four wide position without cover.  He said as he was already very wide, with the turn approaching, he felt it was in NAVEL ORANGEâs best interests to try and improve his position to cross runners to his inside so as not to be unnecessarily wide when making the turn into the Straight.  He added it took NAVEL ORANGE some time to improve its position and this resulted in NAVEL ORANGE having to make a sustained run over an extended period of the race.  He said NAVEL ORANGEâs run consequently finished passing the 200 Metres.
After the race, Z Purton stated that he was not able to offer any excuse for the disappointing performance of MONEY CAFE.

Making the turn after the 1000 Metres, G-ONE LEADER got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of CHINA DELIGHT which was awkwardly placed behind JUMBO SPIRIT.
After the 800 Metres, JUMBO SPIRIT was awkwardly placed outside the heels of FRESH AND FRESH.
Approaching the 50 Metres, TOMâS CHARM was crowded for room between VARA PEARL which got its head on the side and shifted out and SPINNING DANCER (M Demuro) which hung in.  A short distance later, VARA PEARL became unbalanced after being bumped by TOMâS CHARM which remained racing tight inside SPINNING DANCER which continued to hang in despite the efforts of its rider.  As the Stewards were satisfied that M Demuro had made every endeavour to prevent SPINNING DANCER from shifting in, no further action was taken.  Because of this, M Demuro was unable to fully test SPINNING DANCER, which continued to race with its head on the side, over the concluding stages.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that at its last start it had been intended for TOMâS CHARM to be ridden behind the speed from a wide barrier and with cover if possible.  He said on that occasion, from the outside barrier, TOMâS CHARM did not begin as well as he expected and as the horse was drawn wide, he elected to shift it across behind runners in the early stages which resulted in it, although racing successfully, being positioned further back in the field than had been intended.  He said drawn more favourably tonight in barrier 4, he was again asked to try and position TOMâS CHARM behind the speed with cover if possible as it was anticipated that the race would not be run at a quick tempo.  He said after beginning well he had to ride TOMâS CHARM along shortly after the start to cross JUMBO SPIRIT to his inside as that horse was maintaining its position one horse away from the rail and he did not want to be caught unnecessarily wide on TOMâS CHARM.  He said approaching the winning post on the first occasion he was able to shift in to race outside the leader FRESH AND FRESH and as MAZANDARAN and VARA PEARL were racing outside TOMâS CHARM, he had hoped that those horses would continue forward which would provide TOMâS CHARM with cover.  He said however that after passing the winning post on the first occasion MAZANDARAN was steadied to obtain a position with cover behind TOMâS CHARM and whilst VARA PEARL did continue forward, that horse was able to improve into the lead after the 1100 Metres.  He said after VARA PEARL crossed to the lead, the tempo of the race slowed noticeably and TOMâS CHARM improved its position to be racing outside and behind VARA PEARL without cover.  He said the circumstances of the race resulted in TOMâS CHARM being left racing without cover and, in his opinion, this was the reason for the horseâs failure to finish off the race in the Straight.  He added he was of the opinion that TOMâS CHARM does not need to be ridden from back in the field as at its last start when successful, however, the horse performs better when able to be ridden with cover.

B Prebble was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have reacted quicker than he did on this occasion to prevent his mount from shifting ground.  He was further advised to ensure that, wherever possible, he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground and causing crowding to other runners.
Making the turn after the 1000 Metres, FISH Nâ CHIPS was steadied when momentarily crowded for room between MR GENUINE which was taken out by PLEASANT KNIGHT which was racing ungenerously and CAGA FORCE which shifted in marginally.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of TANGO FIRE, J Moreira stated that, from barrier 5, it was expected that TANGO FIRE would be able to obtain a position behind the speed and close to the running rail in the early stages.  He said TANGO FIRE began very well which resulted in the horse being in a prominent position in the early stages.  He said when a number of runners were ridden forward inside TANGO FIRE in the early stages, he attempted to ride his mount along to clear those horses, however, they continued to maintain their positions to the inside of TANGO FIRE and making the turn near the 1000 Metres TANGO FIRE was left racing in a five wide position without cover.  He said it was no longer available for him to continue riding forward due to the manner in which other horses drawn more favourably were ridden, therefore he elected to steady TANGO FIRE and obtain a position with cover closer to the rail.  He said as soon as he positioned TANGO FIRE behind other runners near the 900 Metres, the horse immediately came off the bridle and he had to ride it aggressively along the Back Straight in an endeavour to maintain its position.  He said TANGO FIRE never travelled at any stage of the race and came under heavy pressure near the 500 Metres.  He added, despite being ridden out rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight, TANGO FIRE was disappointing in the manner in which it failed to respond to his riding and weakened in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of TANGO FIRE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, TANGO FIRE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

 When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of UNIVERSAL UNION, J Moreira stated that, from a wide barrier, he shifted his mount across behind runners in the early stages hoping to obtain a position in about midfield.  He said after UNIVERSAL UNION was left racing wide in the early stages, he steadied the horse in order to obtain cover, however, this resulted in it settling further back in the field than had been intended.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion UNIVERSAL UNION travelled keenly and took some time to settle.  He said near the 1000 Metres UNIVERSAL UNION got its head on the side and was awkwardly placed behind CHATER DREAM and inside the heels of ALBICELESTE and for this reason he had to ride his mount after the 1000 Metres in order to hold his position.  He said after this UNIVERSAL UNION travelled only fairly and became unbalanced in its action making the turn after the 500 Metres.  He added in the Straight UNIVERSAL UNION did not finish off the race.  .A veterinary inspection of UNIVERSAL UNION immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, O Doleuze stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on FLAME HERO consistent with the manner in which the horse was ridden at its most recent start when successful over 1600 Metres.  He said on that occasion FLAME HERO was able to obtain the lead in the early stages due to the average tempo of the race at that time.  He said in todayâs race he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position, however, runners drawn more favourably than FLAME HERO showed more early speed and, despite riding his mount along, he was not able to position FLAME HERO in order to cross those runners to his inside.  He said as the tempo of the race in the early stages was good, he felt it was in the best interests of FLAME HERO to obtain a position with cover rather than continue to ride it along in the hope of obtaining a forward position in a race where the sectionals in the early and middle stages were particularly quick.  He added after the 1000 Metres FLAME HERO was left racing wide and without cover in a position further back than had been intended.  He said FLAME HERO came under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn and then in the Straight gave ground noticeably.  He said whilst FLAME HERO raced very disappointingly, there were a number of circumstances with todayâs race as compared to its last start when the horse was successful.  A veterinary inspection of FLAME HERO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of FLAME HERO, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.

When questioned, T Berry stated that it had been hoped that CHEVALIER STAR, which was having its first race start today, would be able to take advantage of its inside barrier and obtain a forward position.  He said however that CHEVALIER STAR began awkwardly and consequently lost ground which resulted in the horse settling at the rear of the field.  He said due to the manner in which the horse began, he had to adjust his left foot in the stirrup iron shortly after the start.  He said after travelling about 100 Metres he slapped his mount down the shoulder in an endeavour to have it make up lost ground, however, CHEVALIER STAR immediately commenced to get its head on the side and lay away from the inside rail.  He said CHEVALIER STAR raced very greenly and continued to lay out away from other runners.  He added due to CHEVALIER STAR being field-shy and wanting to shift ground, it was very awkward to ride, however, he placed the horse under pressure through the middle stages in an endeavour to have it as close to the field as possible.  He said due to the manner in which CHEVALIER STAR was racing, he was reluctant to place the horse under full pressure early in the Straight as he was concerned it would continue to shift ground.  He said despite this, when placed under pressure, CHEVALIER STAR finished off the race satisfactorily.  A veterinary inspection of CHEVALIER STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding his riding in the early stages, U Rispoli stated it had been intended for LAUGHING LORD to obtain a forward position.  He said in the early stages he had intended to immediately shift across behind TONES which had drawn to the inside of LAUGHING LORD, however, that horse became unbalanced in its action approaching the 1100 Metres.  He said after the 1100 Metres when TONES commenced to race more generously, he again steadied LAUGHING LORD with a view to shifting in behind that horse, however, LAUGHING LORD commenced to travel keenly and would not steady sufficiently to allow him to manoeuvre it in behind TONES to a position one horse off the rail with cover.  He said this resulted in LAUGHING LORD having to race in a three wide position.  He added making the first turn after the 900 Metres LAUGHING LORD continued to prove difficult to settle when left racing without cover.  U Rispoli was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must ride his mounts in such a manner so as to ensure that they do not cover unnecessary ground wherever circumstances permit.

LORD SINCLAIR, which was following MASTER KOCHANWONG, was severely checked away from the heels of that horse and shifted out, resulting in ACCESS YEARS being hampered.  The Stewards found that the initial pressure to MASTER KOCHANWONG had occurred when SUPER JOCKEY shifted in slightly away from FLAGSHIP SHINE which was shifting in abruptly to the outside.  N Rawiller was advised that whilst the Stewards were satisfied that he had not directed SUPER JOCKEY in at this time and was still racing in a three wide position when MASTER KOCHANWONG was severely checked, nonetheless he was advised to ensure that he does not shift ground at too acute an angle which can have the result of other runners being influenced.  The Stewards further found that after becoming unbalanced when racing tight outside MASTER KOCHANWONG, SUPER JOCKEY then hung in away from FLAGSHIP SHINE which resulted in MASTER KOCHANWONG having to be severely checked.  Z Purton was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that his mountâs racing manners had played a significant part in this incident, nonetheless he must ensure that he makes every endeavour to react to his mount shifting ground as quickly as possible.

CHEERS VICTORIES and FRIENDS OF YAN OI, which were following, were hampered in consequence and ALL FRIENDS, which was following FRIENDS OF YAN OI, was also shifted out away from the heels of that horse.
The Stewards considered a protest/objection lodged by J Moreira, the rider of SPITFIRE, which finished second, against the winner JOYEUX (Z Purton) alleging interference to his mount near the 100 Metres.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, it was found that near the 250 Metres SPITFIRE and JOYEUX brushed due to both horses shifting minimal ground.  It was further established that passing the 100 Metres JOYEUX shifted in and bumped SPITFIRE before being corrected by its rider.  The Stewards found that whilst there was some contact between the horses near the 100 Metres, having in mind the manner in which both runners finished off their race over the final 100 Metres, they could not be comfortably satisfied that the contact between the horses had materially affected their respective placings at the end of the race.  Accordingly, the protest/objection was overruled and weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.
Throughout the race, STAR OF WAI BO travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.

Passing the 1600 Metres, LIGHTNING AND GOLD was momentarily awkwardly placed close to the heels of AMAZING GIFT.
LIGHTNING AND GOLD was held up for clear running for some distance after the 500 Metres.
Rounding the Home Turn, COSMO ONE, which was giving ground abruptly, became badly unbalanced when crowded for room between LIGHTNING AND GOLD which shifted out marginally and ZACHARY which shifted in after receiving contact from GOLDEN OSMANTHUS which shifted in marginally when improving around ZACHARY.  As the Stewards were of the opinion that this incident had been caused by a number of factors, particularly the manner in which COSMO ONE was giving ground at that time, no further action was taken.
The performance of COSMO ONE, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, COSMO ONE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, N Rawiller (SIR JOHN) stated that he had been instructed to ride the horse similar to the manner in which he rode it last start and that was to take up a leading position and if the pace was strong to allow other runners to cross SIR JOHN.  He said he rode his mount along in the initial stages of the race to take up a forward position, however, after travelling only a short distance commenced to steady SIR JOHN to ascertain the manner in which the horses to his outside, particularly AMAZING GIFT, were being ridden.  He said SIR JOHN showed superior speed in the early stages to runners to his outside without having to be ridden along and for this reason approaching the winning post on the first occasion he was content for SIR JOHN to remain in the lead.  He said however making the turn after passing the winning post on the first occasion SIR JOHN commenced to lay out which he immediately attempted to rectify.  He said when he attempted to prevent SIR JOHN from hanging out, the horse commenced to prove difficult to settle and the more he attempted to restrain it, SIR JOHN was inclined to travel keener still.  He said for this reason he allowed SIR JOHN some rein in an attempt to have the horse race more tractably, however, despite this, SIR JOHN continued to over-race.  He added passing the 1200 Metres COSMO ONE shifted in to race outside and behind SIR JOHN which had the effect of having SIR JOHN continue to over-race.  He said he was aware that the horse was running very fast sectionals and that a break had been established over the main body of the field, however, it was not until passing the 900 Metres that he was able to get SIR JOHN to relax and come back underneath him.  He said he attempted to slow the tempo appreciably at this time as he was aware that the race had been run too quickly to that point.  N Rawiller was advised that whilst it was apparent that SIR JOHN was inclined to travel keenly and lay out, nonetheless given his level of experience, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have made a greater effort than he did to restrain SIR JOHN and set a more moderate tempo.
When questioned, Y T Cheng (COSMO ONE) stated that, from a wide barrier, he had been asked to take up a forward position.  He said he rode his mount along in accordance with his instructions and after the 1200 Metres he was able to clear AMAZING GIFT to race outside and behind the leader SIR JOHN.  He said passing the 1200 Metres he was aware that the race was being run at a quick tempo and he immediately steadied COSMO ONE with a view to obtaining a trailing position behind SIR JOHN with cover.  He added however that when he did this, COSMO ONE commenced to travel keenly and he was not able to shift the horse in behind SIR JOHN until near the 1000 Metres.

O Doleuze (SNOWHOOVES) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that approaching the winning post on the first occasion he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of STRATHTAY, causing that horse to be checked and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  O Doleuze was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 2 April 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Dubai World Cup Racemeeting on Saturday, 28 March 2015.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into consideration Jockey Doleuzeâs good race riding record during the current racing season.  In determining the commencement date of this suspension, the Stewards took into consideration the number of available jockeys for the racemeetings prior to Sunday, 29 March 2015.

When questioned regarding his riding out of SAFARI MAGIC over the concluding stages, Y T Cheng stated that at that time he was racing tight inside WIN IT which restricted the manner in which he was able to ride his mount out.  Nonetheless Y T Cheng conceded that he had misjudged the finishing line which resulted in him not riding SAFARI MAGIC out all the way to the end of the race.  Y T Cheng was severely reprimanded and was told that had SAFARI MAGIC not have run second, he would likely have been asked to face a charge which would necessarily attach to it a significant penalty.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of GRAND HARBOUR, D Whyte stated that he had to make some use of the horse to clear runners to his inside in the early stages.  He said he was somewhat surprised that GRAND HARBOUR took some time to muster speed as he anticipated that he would be able to cross runners drawn more favourably than GRAND HARBOUR easier than what eventuated.  He said after being able to cross to the rail approaching the 1200 Metres, he was able to dictate the tempo of the race, however, GRAND HARBOUR did not settle as well as he had hoped.

When questioned, N Callan (PACKING PINS) stated that, from barrier 13, he had been instructed that if the horse began well to make use of its âgate speedâ and obtain a position in about midfield with cover if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode PACKING PINS positively in the early stages after it began well and attempted to shift across with runners shortly after the start.  He said LUCKY HAMMER was aggressively ridden to maintain its position inside PACKING PINS and after the 1200 Metres PACKING PINS was left racing very wide.  He said due to the makeup of the field at that time, he would have had to restrain PACKING PINS heavily to come back and attempt to find a position with cover which would likely not have occurred as UP AND COMING had obtained a trailing position behind MI SAVVY BOY which was racing directly to the inside of PACKING PINS near the 1000 Metres.  He said it was not available to him to ride forward at this time as the race was being run at a good tempo and he would have had to make too much use of the horse and as a consequence PACKING PINS was left racing in a four wide position without cover throughout the race.  He added PACKING PINS came under pressure rounding the Home Turn and then in the Straight gave ground, however, this was not unexpected given the tough run that the horse endured in the early and middle stages.  Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of PACKING PINS, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Callan and stated that it had been hoped that, despite the horseâs wide barrier, it would be able to obtain a position with cover slightly in front of midfield.

                After being loaded, BETA HEDGE became very fractious and reared on a number of occasions, resulting in its rider, H W Lai, being dislodged.  BETA HEDGE was removed from the barriers and examined by the Veterinary Officer who said the horse appeared sore behind and as such was not suitable to race.  Acting on this advice, the Stewards ordered the withdrawal of BETA HEDGE.  Before being allowed to race again, BETA HEDGE will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.  After the race, H W Lai was examined by the Clubâs medical officers and passed fit to fulfil his remaining race riding engagements.

SOLAR KINGDOM lost its left hind plate approaching the 900 Metres.
Inside the 400 Metres, DIAMOND MASTER commenced to lay in and then near the 200 Metres hung in, causing THE PRINCE to be momentarily inconvenienced.  After this, DIAMOND MASTER continued to race with its head on the side.
After being held up for a run for some distance after the 400 Metres, TOP BONUS, when being shifted to the inside of LEAN JOURNEY to obtain clear running, clipped the heels of that horse and blundered.  TOP BONUS then shifted in and inconvenienced EXTREMELY FUN which then shifted in away from TOP BONUS, causing ADDOLE to be inconvenienced also.

Near the 250 Metres, SUGAR was shifted in away from the heels of LEAN JOURNEY which was giving ground abruptly.
Near the 50 Metres, EXTREMELY FUN shifted out, resulting in SUGAR being taken out onto LEAN JOURNEY which became unbalanced when continuing to give ground.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to ride SUGAR in a forward position if the horse began well, otherwise to attempt to obtain cover in the early stages.  He said after being loaded BETA HEDGE proved very fractious in the adjourning stall, causing SUGAR to become stirred up and then as the start was effected SUGAR bumped the outside of its gate and consequently began only fairly.  He said he did not believe it would be in the best interests of the horse to then be ridden into a forward position, therefore he elected to come back and obtain cover in the early stages.  He said this resulted in SUGAR racing much further back in the field than had been intended.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of LEAN JOURNEY, B Prebble stated that he had ridden the horse in an official barrier trial since its last start with blinkers on and the horse performed extremely well in this trial.  He said he had also ridden LEAN JOURNEY in a number of pieces of work both prior to and since that barrier trial and all of this work had been good.  He said in its barrier trial and in its work LEAN JOURNEY had travelled fluently and based on this good work the horse was expected to run well today.  He said in the early stages LEAN JOURNEY did not travel comfortably and he became concerned with the manner in which the horse was racing after the 800 Metres.  He said passing the 600 Metres LEAN JOURNEY was inclined to shift ground and the horse came under pressure after the 500 Metres to maintain its position.  He added despite being placed under heavy pressure after the 400 Metres, he was concerned by the abrupt manner in which LEAN JOURNEY gave ground albeit that the horse was galloped on behind after the 400 Metres.  He said the manner in which LEAN JOURNEY raced today was in stark contrast to the manner in which it trialed in the lead up to this race.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of LEAN JOURNEY, stated that based on the strength of its work since its last run, he advised the owners that he anticipated LEAN JOURNEY would run well today.  He said as LEAN JOURNEY had performed well in its barrier trial in the lead up to this race when ridden in the lead, he asked Jockey Prebble to ride it in the same manner.  He said having in mind the manner in which the horse had raced today, he may decide to have it ridden with cover in future to see if it can perform better.  The performance of LEAN JOURNEY was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LEAN JOURNEY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of THE PRINCE and EXTREMELY FUN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HAPPY MOMENTS, J Moreira stated that although the horse had some excuses today, nonetheless HAPPY MOMENTS was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race as he expected.  He said he had to make some use of HAPPY MOMENTS passing the winning post on the first occasion in order to obtain a position closer to the rail as HAPPY MOMENTS was left racing very wide approaching and passing the 1400 Metres.  He said nonetheless he was able to obtain a position with cover and HAPPY MOMENTS travelled comfortably throughout the middle stages, however, when placed under pressure, the horse did not finish off the race as he anticipated.  A veterinary inspection of HAPPY MOMENTS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HAPPY MOMENTS, a favourite for todayâs race, was considered unacceptable.

When questioned, J Moreira (PRINCIPAL) stated that it had been intended for the horse to be ridden behind the speed if possible as it had not finished off its race at its last start when required to do too much work in the early stages.  He said it was felt that todayâs race would not be run at a fast tempo and that PRINCIPAL would be able to obtain a trailing position without too much use having to be made of the horse in the early stages.  He said shortly after the start he noticed SICHUAN VIGOUR being ridden along to the inside of PRINCIPAL and as he anticipated that this horse would take up a forward position, he shifted PRINCIPAL across to follow SICHUAN VIGOUR forward.  He said however that passing the 1500 Metres he was left racing in a four wide position outside SANTA FE SUN which was being aggressively ridden in the early stages to establish its position inside PRINCIPAL.

When questioned, O Doleuze stated that he had been asked to ride ARCHERâS BOW in a position with cover in about midfield if possible.  He said in the early stages he shifted ARCHERâS BOW to race outside COOL PAL which was being aggressively ridden.  He said he steadied ARCHERâS BOW with a view to shifting his mount behind COOL PAL, however, this took some time as COOL PAL was slow to muster speed in the early stages despite being aggressively ridden.  He said after the 1600 Metres he attempted to obtain a position behind HONG KONG FAT, however, ON THE WAY improved its positon to be racing on the back of that horse which resulted in ARCHERâS BOW being left racing in a position three wide.  He added passing the winning post on the first occasion he noticed a gap existed in advance of HONG KONG FAT and therefore he rode his mount along in an endeavour to obtain this position one horse off the rail in front of that horse.  He said as he did this, approaching the 1200 Metres horses to the inside of ARCHERâS BOW were ridden along and as the tempo of the race slackened, the gap between HONG KONG FAT and SURE CHAMP in advance of that horse closed which resulted in ARCHERâS BOW being left racing three wide and without cover for the remainder of the race.

When questioned, O Doleuze stated that as WHISTLE BLOWER had travelled keenly when ridden in a forward position at its last start and had consequently raced disappointingly, he was asked to ride the horse more conservatively tonight from barrier 11.  He said it was felt that there was sufficient speed in the race that if WHISTLE BLOWER were to be ridden forward, the horse would again prove difficult to settle and would not be able to finish off its race.  He said therefore he shifted WHISTLE BLOWER across in the early stages and was able to obtain cover behind SECRET AGENT in a position just worse than midfield.  He said after following SECRET AGENT throughout the race, WHISTLE BLOWER came under pressure rounding the Home Turn and again did not finish off its race.  Mr P OâSullivan, the trainer of WHISTLE BLOWER, stated that after WHISTLE BLOWER drew wide in tonightâs race, he was of the opinion that were the horse to be aggressively ridden in the early stages, WHISTLE BLOWER would likely over-race and consequently would not perform well due to the amount of work the horse would have to do to cross from its wide barrier.  He added as WHISTLE BLOWER had raced disappointingly last start, he elected to have the horse ridden off the speed in the hope that it would be able to close off the race more strongly than it did.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered if PEACE ON EARTH (H W Lai) had been afforded a fair start.  Evidence was taken from H W Lai, Mr D E Ferraris, the trainer of PEACE ON EARTH, and Mr T McGovern, the Starter.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, it was established that just prior to the start being effected, PEACE ON EARTH became fractious and turned its head to the left.  It was further established that at this time PEACE ON EARTH was being assisted by a starting gate handler who was attempting to straighten its head and as this was occurring, the start was effected, resulting in PEACE ON EARTH losing ground.  The Stewards formed the view that only just prior to the start being effected PEACE ON EARTH had turned its head to the left of its own accord and that the starting gate handler had not prevented it from beginning, rather he was attempting to assist the horse at this time.  As the Stewards were of the opinion that PEACE ON EARTH had caused its own difficulties by becoming fractious momentarily before the start was effected, that horse was deemed to have had a fair start and weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.  Before being allowed to race again, PEACE ON EARTH will be required to perform satisfactorily in a stalls test.

Approaching the 900 Metres, STAR MAJESTIC was left racing without cover and was consequently ridden forward to improve its position.
When questioned, N Callan stated that it had been intended for LITTLE DRAGON to obtain a forward position and hopefully sit outside whatever horse led the race.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode LITTLE DRAGON aggressively in the early stages to obtain a forward position.  He said HORSE OF FORTUNE was ridden to maintain its position to the inside of LITTLE DRAGON and as he had pushed his horse in the early stages to go forward, he did not believe it was in its best interests to continue to ride LITTLE DRAGON forward as it appeared to him that the rider of HORSE OF FORTUNE was intent on maintaining its position.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion he steadied LITTLE DRAGON with a view to obtaining a position with cover behind HORSE OF FORTUNE.  He said however at this time TURBO JEWELLERY held its position one horse off the rail which resulted in LITTLE DRAGON being left racing in a three wide position without cover.  He added the tempo of the race slowed after the 1200 Metres, however, as LITTLE DRAGON had taken some time to settle after being aggressively ridden in the early stages, he was reluctant to again start urging LITTLE DRAGON forward to improve its position.  He said therefore he remained racing in a three wide positon and when STAR MAJESTIC improved its position after the 900 Metres, he then allowed LITTLE DRAGON to improve its position to race one horse off the rail outside and behind STAR MAJESTIC.

He said he persevered in an endeavour to improve to the outside of OVETT and inside FLYING MOOCHI until after the 300 Metres at which point he steadied his mount when disappointed for running between those horses due to OVETT shifting out.  He said SUPEROI was then awkwardly placed close to the heels of OVETT for some distance and it was not until near the 200 Metres that he was able to shift SUPEROI to the inside of the heels of OVETT into clear running.  Apprentice Lui was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must, wherever circumstances permit, do his utmost to shift in away from heels at the earliest opportunity so as to provide clear running for his mounts.

When questioned, O Doleuze stated that he had been provided the same instructions on KERKENI tonight as he was at its most recent start and that was to obtain a forward position if possible.  He said at its most recent start he rode the horse aggressively in the early stages, however, a number of other runners showed superior speed to KERKENI which resulted in his mount racing behind the speed.  He said, from barrier 12 tonight, he was again asked to ride KERKENI in a forward position as the horse had raced successfully overseas when ridden in or about the lead.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages and passing the winning post on the first occasion KERKENI was left racing very wide.  He said therefore he allowed his mount to continue to improve its position and after the 1000 Metres was able to shift in to race outside GRACEFUL KINGDOM.  He added he then attempted to steady his mount as he was aware that he had had to make use of KERKENI to obtain this position.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that as it was anticipated tonightâs race would be run at a strong tempo, he was asked to ride DR GOOD HABIT in about a midfield position if possible.  He said it was explained to him that DR GOOD HABIT is not the fastest horse to begin and, from the wide barrier tonight, it was anticipated that too much use would have to be made of the horse in the early stages when carrying top weight were it to be ridden forward.  He said after DR GOOD HABIT began better than expected, he did give some consideration to allowing his mount to stride forward, however, he became aware that a significant number of horses were being ridden aggressively to his inside and therefore in the early stages he elected to shift DR GOOD HABIT across behind runners and obtained a trailing position behind WONDERFUL GUY which resulted in the horse racing slightly further back in the field than had been intended.  He added DR GOOD HABIT improved into the race nicely rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight and, in his opinion, was going to finish off the race strongly until the horseâs momentum was impeded near the 200 Metres due to a shift out from the inside of DR GOOD HABIT.
A veterinary inspection of GRACEFUL KINGDOM immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

Then a short distance after the start, GREAT RUN was steadied when crowded for room between HONG KONG DANCER which got its head on the side and lay in after making contact with GREAT RUN and ORIENTAL PROSPER which shifted out initially before being taken out further by GENTILIS.  In this incident, ORIENTAL PROSPER became unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by GREAT RUN.  After this, ORIENTAL PROSPER was aggressively ridden, however, failed to muster speed and consequently raced back in the field.
From a wide barrier, BRIGHT STAR was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Approaching the 1100 Metres, HONG KONG DANCER was steadied away from the heels of CALLING WITH LOVE which shifted in when awkwardly placed inside the heels of LONGWAH AMBER.

                MOBILE KING began awkwardly.
DRAGON BACHELOR was slow to begin.
SUPER HORSE and HEAR THE ROAR bumped at the start.  A short distance later, SUPER HORSE was steadied when crowded for room between HEAR THE ROAR and GLAMOROUS RYDER which shifted out.
ZERO ENERGY ACT and WIN CHANCE were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
For some distance passing the 1300 Metres, GLAMOROUS RYDER was awkwardly placed close to the heels of COLOURFUL PROFIT.
After the 1000 Metres, COLOURFUL PROFIT raced with its head on the side and lay in.
Shortly after entering the Straight, HEAR THE ROAR was checked when endeavouring to improve to the inside of DRAGON BACHELOR and outside WIN CHANCE which, after initially shifting out of its own accord, was then taken out by SUPER STRIKE.  In this incident, DRAGON BACHELOR became badly unbalanced after being heavily bumped on the hindquarters by HEAR THE ROAR.  As the Stewards were satisfied that as HEAR THE ROAR was endeavouring to improve into running outside WIN CHANCE, at no stage had it established clear running to the outside of that horse, no further action was taken.
Over the final 50 Metres, COLOURFUL PROFIT, which was closing off the race well, was checked away from the heels of KING HARADASUN when initially unable to improve between that horse and GLAMOROUS RYDER.  Consequently COLOURFUL PROFIT was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
Throughout the race, WIN CHANCE travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that as KING HARADASUN had been getting too far out of its ground in recent races, it was decided to attempt to have the horse ridden in a more forward position today if possible.  He said after beginning fairly, he rode KING HARADASUN aggressively in the early stages and the horse responded positively and was able to obtain the lead on the rail passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said after this KING HARADASUN relaxed quite well, however, after entering the Back Straight was inclined to travel keenly.  He said he attempted to steady the tempo on KING HARADASUN as much as possible without having to restrain the horse too strongly.  He said although he was aware that the race was being run at a faster tempo than he would have preferred, particularly after the 800 Metres, he believed it would have been detrimental to KING HARADASUNâs chances had he have attempted to restrain the horse heavily as it was travelling strongly at this time, therefore he allowed it to continue to stride.  He added in the Straight KING HARADASUN finished off the race well although it peaked on its run late in the race.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of ARCHIPPUS, K C Leung stated that the tempo of the race in the early stages was quicker than that at its last start when the horse was successful.  He said after the 700 Metres ARCHIPPUS was taken into a three wide position without cover by WAH MAY BABY which shifted out.  He said ARCHIPPUS came under pressure in the early part of the Straight and despite being hampered near the 250 Metres was most disappointing in the manner in which it failed to finish off the race.

Apprentice Lui was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must ensure that he rides his mounts in a competitive manner.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that, in his opinion, the tempo of the race in the early and middle stages did not suit GOOD GOOD VIEW.  He said GOOD GOOD VIEW commenced to prove difficult to settle for some distance after the 1200 Metres and was checked away from the heels of STEP HIGH.  He said GOOD GOOD VIEW never properly settled in the race during the early and middle stages and then rounding the Home Turn was taken wider by RED DANCER which shifted out to its inside.  He added he placed GOOD GOOD VIEW under pressure in the early part of the Straight, however, the horse did not respond to his riding and did not quicken at any stage.  He said whilst GOOD GOOD VIEW was disappointing, nonetheless he felt that there were some circumstances which contributed to the horseâs performance.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of GOOD GOOD VIEW, stated that the horse had pleased him in its work since its last start success which had been the same as it was prior to that run.  He said he had been surprised that GOOD GOOD VIEWâs body weight had increased in the lead up to todayâs race as he had not done anything differently with the horseâs work or feeding regime.  He said, in his opinion, todayâs disappointing performance could be attributed to the fact that GOOD GOOD VIEW had not settled in the early and middle stages as it was able to do at its last run.

After this, HAPPY MOMENTS continued to lay out and proved difficult to ride and over the concluding stages was awkwardly placed inside the heels of CHINA DELIGHT.
When questioned, C Y Ho stated that he had been instructed to take up a forward position on DASHING SUPER from the outside barrier.  He said DASHING SUPER was slow to begin and therefore he had to ride the horse along in the early stages to have it travel forward and clear other runners to its inside.  He said shortly after the start DASHING SUPER commenced to improve its position and he was able to make up lost ground without having to ride it along too vigorously.  He said making the first turn after passing the winning post on the first occasion he was able to position DASHING SUPER in a three wide position outside the leader.  He said he did give some thought to pressing on to see if DASHING SUPER could obtain the outright lead or obtain a position closer to the rail rather than remain racing three wide.  He added, however, he felt that given the circumstances of the race up to about the 1400 Metres he believed he would have had to make too much use of DASHING SUPER in an attempt to cross KING OF REASON and JOLLY GOOD STAR to its inside and that these horses would likely be ridden so as not to surrender their leading positions.  He said passing the 1400 Metres DASHING SUPER was only travelling fairly and he did not believe that the horse was travelling strongly enough, given the tempo of the race, to attempt to obtain the lead.  C Y Ho was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that the manner in which DASHING SUPER began from the outside barrier made his task of leading more difficult, nonetheless, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have made an effort in the early and middle stages to press forward to see if it was possible to clear the runners to his inside to avoid travelling wide and without cover.

The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered if CULTURAL CITY had been afforded a fair start.  Evidence was taken from M L Yeung and Trainer A Lee as well as the Starter, Mr T McGovern.  After viewing the videos, it was ascertained that as the start was effected CULTURAL CITY put its head down to the left, resulting in the horse losing a significant amount of ground.  As the Stewards were satisfied that CULTURAL CITY had caused its own difficulties, the horse was deemed to have been afforded a fair start and accordingly was declared to be a runner.  Before being allowed to race again, CULTURAL CITY, which subsequently finished tailed out, will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong (SAFARI MAGIC) stated that after the 800 Metres he was in a position racing behind BUDDY BUDDIES and slightly to the inside of SAMMYâS EMPIRE.  He said making the turn after the 700 Metres he observed that both BUDDY BUDDIES and SAMMYâS EMPIRE were being ridden along and he expected SAMMYâS EMPIRE to continue forward with BUDDY BUDDIES at this time which would hopefully have provided SAFARI MAGIC with the opportunity to shift to the outside of SAMMYâS EMPIRE and inside FRESH AND FRESH to commence a forward move on the outside of runners.  He said however that after passing the 700 Metres it became apparent to him that SAMMYâS EMPIRE did not quicken as well as BUDDY BUDDIES, he shifted SAFARI MAGIC to the inside of SAMMYâS EMPIRE to improve his position.  He said when he did this, SAFARI MAGIC momentarily raced tight inside SAMMYâS EMPIRE which lay in, however, he was able to commence to ride his mount along vigorously passing the 600 Metres.  He added however that this resulted in BUDDY BUDDIES establishing a break over SAFARI MAGIC.  Apprentice Wong was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have trailed BUDDY BUDDIES passing the 800 Metres and taken the opportunity to improve his position when that horse went forward rather than racing behind SAMMYâS EMPIRE given the relative chances of the two horses in question.

He said on that occasion WILD BOY was able to race inside the leader on the rail and, in his opinion, it appeared to appreciate being ridden in this manner.  He said today it was intended for the horse to be ridden in a similar way, however, APOLLO CAVALIER clearly showed more speed than WILD BOY in the early stages and for this reason WILD BOY had to shift away from the rail approaching the Home Turn to come around that horse in order to obtain clear running.

He said after riding his mount along vigorously prior to the 400 Metres and rounding the Home Turn, he commenced to attempt to shift to the outside of SECRET AGENT.  He said however when it became apparent to him near the 250 Metres that he was going to have to shift CITY POWER out in an endeavour to improve to the outside of SECRET AGENT, he directed GOLDEN CHOPSTICKS back to the inside of SECRET AGENT and outside MI SAVVY after which the horse closed off the race strongly.  He said at no stage did he have to stop riding GOLDEN CHOPSTICKS as the horse was improving behind SECRET AGENT.  H W Lai was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, it was of concern to the Stewards that he had neglected to position GOLDEN CHOPSTICKS to improve between SECRET AGENT and MI SAVVY earlier than he did given that at all relevant times there was a clear run between those horses.  He was severely reprimanded and advised that he must ride his mounts in such a manner so as to ensure that they are not open to query.

He said as he had been instructed to take up a forward position on TOP ACE, he then rode his mount along in the early stages, however, throughout the race the horse was forced to race wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.  Y T Cheng was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, his riding of TOP ACE lacked the necessary level of judgement and initiative expected of a senior rider.  He was further advised that, given that TOP ACE had been slow to begin, he should have endeavoured to obtain a position closer to the rail albeit further back than had been intended, given the high likelihood that TOP ACE was going to be required to travel wide and without cover after having to be ridden along in an endeavour to overcome the horseâs slow beginning.

Having in mind the manner in which BOTH SURE did not stretch out for the majority of the race, the Stewards ruled that the horse must barrier trial satisfactorily and be subjected to an official veterinary examination prior to being permitted to race again.
A veterinary inspection of COUNTRY MELODY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

                On arrival at the Start, it was noted that SPICY SIAM had lost its left front plate.  This plate was refitted.  SPICY SIAM was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.
ALWAYS SOMETHING and RUGBY AMBASSADOR were crowded for room on jumping between OCEAN POWER and SPICY SIAM which shifted out.
From the outside barriers, FORTUNE GIGGLES and NO REGRETS were shifted across behind runners shortly after the start.
After the 1500 Metres, CHINA DELIGHT got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of ROUGE ET BLANC.
Approaching the 1400 Metres, TELEPHATIA and SPICY SIAM raced tight.
After the 800 Metres, OXFORD CHARLEY was awkwardly placed close to the heels of PERCY JACKSON.
Throughout the race, OCEAN POWER travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
When questioned, A Suborics (RUGBY AMBASSADOR) stated that approaching the 1600 Metres he was able to shift in to race outside the leader BETTER ANNOUNCE.  He said he attempted to steady RUGBY AMBASSADOR to maintain this position, however, RUGBY AMBASSADOR commenced to prove difficult to settle and was inclined to travel keenly.  He said when it appeared that BETTER ANNOUNCE was being steadied to slow the tempo after the 1500 Metres, he allowed RUGBY AMBASSADOR to improve its position forward of that horse after the 1400 Metres and to take the outright lead near the 1200 Metres.  He said after allowing RUGBY AMBASSADOR to cross into the lead, the horse settled better and for this reason he was reluctant to further steady RUGBY AMBASSADOR as it was travelling comfortably.  He added although this resulted in the race being run at a slightly faster sectional than he had hoped between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres, he felt it was better to allow the horse to use its action rather than have it travel keenly.
When questioned regarding his riding of OXFORD CHARLEY in the Straight, O Doleuze stated that in the early part of the Straight he rode his mount aggressively to improve inside PERCY JACKSON.  He said however that when OXFORD CHARLEY was hampered near the 300 Metres when PERCY JACKSON shifted in, he was obliged to steady his mount.  He said he then positioned OXFORD CHARLEY behind PERCY JACKSON in order to establish whether clear running would become available to the inside of that horse and behind RUGBY AMBASSADOR or to the outside of PERCY JACKSON and behind BETTER ANNOUNCE.  He said as RUGBY AMBASSADOR appeared to be stopping, he committed OXFORD CHARLEY to the outside of PERCY JACKSON after the 200 Metres, however, after this OXFORD CHARLEY was not able to obtain clear running due to ALWAYS SOMETHING being positioned to the outside of BETTER ANNOUNCE.  O Doleuze was advised that his riding particularly over the final 300 Metres had come under notice in that it had lacked the necessary urgency expected of a rider.  He was advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to improve into runs as they become available and accordingly be fully tested wherever possible.  A veterinary inspection of OXFORD CHARLEY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of FORTUNE GIGGLES immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horseâs trachea.  The performance of FORTUNE GIGGLES, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FORTUNE GIGGLES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Throughout the race, FUN TAPESTRY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding his riding of PLENTY OF SPEED, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he had been asked to lead if possible, however, if another runner was intent on leading, he should allow PLENTY OF SPEED to be positioned to the outside of that horse.  He said PLENTY OF SPEED began only fairly and he had to ride his mount along to recover lost ground.  He said near the 1100 Metres he was able to shift in to race outside MASTER VIKING which was positioned on the rail.  He said, in his opinion, at this time PLENTY OF SPEED was not travelling comfortably and for this reason he was reluctant to push his mount to cross MASTER VIKING.  Apprentice Wong was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, given the manner in which MASTER VIKING was being ridden and the average tempo of the race at the relevant stages, PLENTY OF SPEEDâs interests would have been better served by allowing that horse to continue on into the outright lead rather than continuing to race outside and in advance of MASTER VIKING.

When questioned, D Lane (NUMERO UNO) stated that he had been asked to lead if possible, however, if the pace was too fast, to obtain a position behind the leaders.  He said after NUMERO UNO began only fairly, he rode his mount along in the early stages to make up lost ground, however, NUMERO UNO was quickly crossed by GRACEFUL KINGDOM shortly after the start.  He said when GRACEFUL KINGDOM was steadied to allow horses from wide out to obtain forward positions, this resulted in NUMERO UNO settling further back in the field than had been intended.  He said after the 1200 Metres he rode NUMERO UNO along to maintain the position behind GRACEFUL KINGDOM, however, NUMERO UNO was reluctant to maintain this position when racing tight inside DR GOOD HABIT.  He added, despite being ridden along, NUMERO UNO was unable to maintain its position and consequently DR GOOD HABIT was able to shift in to follow GRACEFUL KINGDOM in front of NUMERO UNO.  He said these factors resulted in the horse being much further back in the field than had been anticipated.  He said in the early part of the Straight NUMERO UNO quickened well, however, over the final 200 Metres finished off the race only one-paced.
When questioned, K Teetan stated it was anticipated that there were a number of runners which were capable of leading and therefore it was expected that DR GOOD HABIT would be able to obtain a good trailing position from barrier 4.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages, however, DR GOOD HABIT was reluctant to stretch out.  He said throughout the early stages DR GOOD HABIT was inclined to lay in away from other runners and gave the impression it was reluctant to maintain its position when having to race amongst other horses.  He said because of the manner in which DR GOOD HABIT was racing in the early stages, the horse settled further back in the field than had been intended.  He added DR GOOD HABIT did not travel well at any stage of the race and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of DR GOOD HABIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

AMERICAN FAME was also held up for clear running rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight.
ZERO ENERGY ACT lost its left front plate approaching the winning post.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MY CUP OVERFLOWS, O Doleuze stated that although his mount was obliged to race wide and without cover for the majority of the race, he did not put this down as the reason for the horseâs disappointing performance.  He said during the race MY CUP OVERFLOWS travelled well and he expected the horse to respond to his riding when placed under pressure.  He said after commencing to ride his mount along after the 600 Metres, MY CUP OVERFLOWS immediately came under pressure and was most disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race in the Straight.  He added although MY CUP OVERFLOWS travelled well, he felt that the horse was not as comfortable in its action as when it was successful at its last start.  A veterinary inspection of MY CUP OVERFLOWS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MY CUP OVERFLOWS, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MY CUP OVERFLOWS will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the performance of BRIGHT CONCEPT which was having its first start on the All Weather surface today, Z Purton stated that he had to make some use of the horse in the early stages to obtain a forward position from barrier 10.  He said after being left racing wide after the 1400 Metres, he continued on into the lead when LUCKY PIONEER was steadied after the 1100 Metres.  He said BRIGHT CONCEPT was disappointing in the manner in which it then failed to finish off the race, however, he did state that the horse had previously run well when able to race beside another runner which was not the case in todayâs race.  A veterinary inspection of BRIGHT CONCEPT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

The performance of GALLANT ROCK, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, GALLANT ROCK will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of GLORIOUS AVENUE, Z Purton stated that despite being ridden along in the early stages the horse failed to show early speed.  He said GLORIOUS AVENUE was not comfortable in its action throughout the race and was inclined to âclimbâ.  He said he was required to ride GLORIOUS AVENUE along throughout the race in an endeavour to maintain its action, however, the horse gave ground abruptly in the Straight and over the latter stages shortened stride noticeably.  He said after the race GLORIOUS AVENUE stumbled on a number of occasions, however, he was not able to detect any obvious lameness issues.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of GLORIOUS AVENUE, was unable to offer any explanation for the horseâs disappointing performance other than it was found to have some blood issues after the race.  He said the horse had pleased him in the lead up to todayâs race and a forward showing was expected.  A veterinary inspection of GLORIOUS AVENUE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of GLORIOUS AVENUE, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, GLORIOUS AVENUE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Approaching the 100 Metres, E-SUPER got its head on the side, shifted out under pressure and made contact with FAY DEEP.
When questioned, O Doleuze stated that it had been hoped that MASSIVE MOVE may be able to obtain cover in a forward position.  He said after beginning very well he rode his mount along in the early stage to take up a forward position and then had hoped that other runners would improve to allow MASSIVE MOVE to obtain a trailing position  He said however that MASSIVE MOVE over-raced in the early stages and travelled too keenly.  He said with PROMPT EXPRESS racing directly to its inside and SUGAR being positioned to its outside, MASSIVE MOVE continued to travel keenly after the 800 Metres.  He said for this reason approaching the 600 Metres he allowed MASSIVE MOVE some rein to establish a margin over PROMPT EXPRESS and SUGAR in order to see if the horse would relax better without horses being positioned around it.  He added it was also for this reason that he allowed MASSIVE MOVE to race away from SUGAR to its outside as he did not want to shift MASSIVE MOVE more towards the outside rail and consequently be obliged to race amongst horses.  He said MASSIVE MOVE went from travelling too well to off the bridle after the 500 Metres and immediately came under pressure and then did not respond to his riding for the remainder of the race.  He said given that as MASSIVE MOVE had worked well for some time and had been disappointing in its races, he recommended to connections that they consider stepping the horse up in distance and riding it more conservatively to see if it will travel more kindly in its races in future.  A veterinary inspection of MASSIVE MOVE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said after initially proving reluctant to enter the stalls, FIVE UP HIGH then became fractious and began awkwardly, resulting in it losing ground.  He said after this he had to ride FIVE UP HIGH along in the early stages to take up a forward position as instructed, however, FIVE UP HIGH was able to shift across beside runners without too much use having to be made of it.

He said however that there were a number of runners which had already established positions behind the leaders and when it was no longer available for him to take a trailing position, he allowed FASTER MORE to progress into the lead rather than remain racing unnecessary wide.  He added after obtaining the lead after the 1200 Metres, he was able to steady the tempo on FASTER MORE and dictate the terms of the race.

D Whyte stated that after this incident his mount commenced to over-race and was awkwardly placed close to the heels of POPPING CANDY for some distance.  He said he was able to get the horse to relax better near the 700 Metres and then it travelled satisfactorily until just prior to the Home Turn at which time the horse became unbalanced after coming under pressure.  He added whilst HIT THE BID had proved difficult to settle in the middle stages, nonetheless he felt that the horse was disappointing as it did not respond to his riding when placed under pressure.

When questioned, C Y Ho stated that after having been instructed to obtain a forward position on HORSE APLENTY, he rode his mount vigorously in the early stages to clear runners to his inside.  He said at all times from on jumping until well after passing the winning post on the first occasion he pushed his mount in an endeavour to have it cross runners to its inside, however, HORSE APLENTY did not show enough early speed and consequently was left racing in a three wide position without cover after the 1300 Metres.  He said although the tempo of the race in the early stages had been relatively sedate, after the 1200 Metres he felt that KERKENI, which was leading, and NONE OTHER, which was racing to the immediate inside of HORSE APLENTY, were travelling strongly and he believed that had he allowed HORSE APLENTY to improve its position, the riders of those horses would have continued to hold their position.  He said having in mind how much use he had made of HORSE APLENTY in the early stages, he felt that it would not be in its best interests to continue to push his mount forward.  He added for this reason HORSE APLENTY was left racing three wide and without cover throughout the race.

The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the prima facie view that an incident had occurred over the final 50 Metres which cast doubt on whether TRAVEL RENYI (O Doleuze) should be declared the winner of the race.  Subsequently K Teetan, the rider of BLIZZARD, second placegetter, lodged a protest/objection against TRAVEL RENYI being declared the winner alleging interference to his mount over about the final 50 Metres.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, the Stewards found that near the 50 Metres TRAVEL RENYI shifted in under pressure and bumped BLIZZARD and that over the concluding stages TRAVEL RENYI continued to shift in and bump BLIZZARD, causing that horse to become badly unbalanced.  Having regard to the manner in which the horses were closing off the race and the nose margin between TRAVEL RENYI and BLIZZARD at the end of the race, the Stewards were comfortably satisfied that the interference had affected the finishing positions of the horses.  Accordingly, the protest/objection was sustained and the placings were amended to read No. 14, BLIZZARD, 1st; No. 10, TRAVEL RENYI, 2nd; No. 2, TONYBOY, 3rd; and No. 5, MULTIMAX, 4th.

When questioned, J Moreira stated that he had not been given any specific instructions on how to ride STAR MAJESTIC from barrier 9, however, it was anticipated that the horse would obtain a position in midfield or slightly behind midfield.  He said in the early stages he was left racing wide and therefore he steadied his mount approaching the winning post on the first occasion to obtain a position closer to the rail with cover.  He said this resulted in STAR MAJESTIC having to race at the rear of the field.  He said passing the 600 Metres HAPPY ROCKY, which was racing to his outside, was shifted out and commenced to sustain a long run around the field.  He said as that horse was lightly weighted and STAR MAJESTIC was carrying top weight, he did not feel that it would be in the best interests of STAR MAJESTIC were he to shift out and attempt to follow that horse.  He said therefore he elected to pursue inside runs.  He said he was able to continue to improve his position without being held up rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight STAR MAJESTIC finished well after having to race in a position further back in the field than had been hoped.

He said although FOREVER ACCURATE did not feel comfortable in its action when giving ground, he was not able to detect any lameness issues with the horse.  A veterinary inspection of FOREVER ACCURATE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Before being allowed to race again, FOREVER ACCURATE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding his riding of STARTING OVER, O Doleuze stated that from the outside barrier he had been asked to shift the horse across behind runners in the early stages and obtain inside runs if possible.  He said after taking STARTING OVER across behind the field in the early stages, the horse became somewhat detached from the main body of the field due to the fast tempo of the race in the early and middle stages.  He said he was able to position STARTING OVER to be following LUCKY SCEPTER after the 800 Metres as he felt that this horse may be able to take him into the Home Straight and then shift to the outside of it upon entering the Home Straight.  He said after making the Home Turn he immediately shifted STARTING OVER to the outside of LUCKY SCEPTER and commenced to ride his mount along.  He said near the 300 Metres STARTING OVER shifted in abruptly and became unbalanced and for this reason he changed the whip over into his right hand.  He said when he did this, STARTING OVER then shifted out.  He said because of the manner in which STARTING OVER was shifting ground, he was reluctant to use the whip and only used it sparingly over the latter stages of the race, however, at all times he rode his mount out vigorously hands and heels.  O Doleuze was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted STARTING OVER had shifted ground in the Straight particularly at the 300 Metres, nonetheless he should ensure that he rides his mounts out to the best of his capabilities wherever circumstances permit.
When questioned regarding his riding of OUTLAWED, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he had been given explicit instructions to lead on the horse as it was successful at its last start when ridden in this manner.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode OUTLAWED vigorously in the early stages and was able to shift in to race outside SOLAR KINGDOM after the 1100 Metres.  He said he continued to ride OUTLAWED along in the hope that Y T Cheng, the rider of SOLAR KINGDOM, would steady his mount and allow OUTLAWED to cross.  He said however that SOLAR KINGDOM maintained its position and because of his instructions he felt obliged to continue to ride OUTLAWED along even though he was aware that the race was being run at a fast tempo.  He said after the 800 Metres he discontinued riding OUTLAWED along, however, after the 600 Metres had to again ride it along to maintain its position.  Trainer P F Yiu confirmed that the instructions provided to Apprentice Wong were to attempt to lead given these tactics were successful at its last start.  He said whilst he was aware that SOLAR KINGDOM had shown pace in its races, he was hopeful that OUTLAWED would be able to cross that horse.  He said given the tempo of the race and the amount of work that Apprentice Wong did on OUTLAWED, he felt that OUTLAWEDâs chances would have best been served by him steadying his mount making the first turn rather than continuing on and attempting to obtain the lead.  Apprentice Wong was advised that whilst he is a 10 lb claiming jockey, nonetheless, in the opinion of the Stewards, he had erred in continuing to press for the lead after having to ride his mount along for such an extended period, particularly given that SOLAR KINGDOM was travelling strongly to the inside of OUTLAWED.

Over the final 50 Metres, GOOD FRIENDS MAGIC was checked when unable to improve due to racing on the heels of TRAVEL MASTER and CHINA GOOD.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of JUN HAO, D Whyte stated that although his mount was inclined to travel strongly for a short distance after the 800 Metres, overall he was satisfied with the manner in which it travelled in the early and middle stages.  He said at the entrance to the Straight he shifted JUN HAO out to improve around TRAVEL MASTER and JUN HAO immediately commenced to get its head on the side and lay out.  He said he placed JUN HAO under pressure after the 400 Metres and the horse then commenced to hang out and proved difficult to ride.  A veterinary inspection of JUN HAO immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, JUN HAO will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of NATURAL EIGHT, C Y Ho stated that unlike last Wednesday night when successful, NATURAL EIGHT was more worked up prior to the start today and was fractious in the barriers.  He said he was able to obtain a good position on NATURAL EIGHT during the race, however, the horse came under pressure prior to the Home Turn and then when asked for an effort in the Straight did not respond to his riding and was disappointing.  He added that the only reason he could offer for the horseâs disappointing performance was the fact that it may not have backed up after its run last Wednesday night.  A veterinary inspection of NATURAL EIGHT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, D Whyte stated that shortly after entering the Straight he became concerned with RUGBY DIAMONDâs action as the horse became unbalanced and appeared to be uncoordinated.

Close to the finishing line, CALIFORNIA BOUNTY was awkwardly placed outside the heels of NOT LISTENINâTOME.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of JETWINGS, O Doleuze stated that his mount has a history of being difficult in the barriers and because of this it was loaded into the stalls late which is customary.  He said just prior to the start being effected, JETWINGS became fractious and then as the start was effected reared, resulting in the horse losing ground.  He said JETWINGS was able to recover lost ground in the early stages and after the 800 Metres had shifted in to obtain a trailing position behind LOVELY DELOVELY.  He said JETWINGS travelled only fairly and for this reason near the 500 Metres he shifted the horse out away from the heels of LOVELY DELOVELY to see whether it would travel better and finish off the race.  He added after being placed under pressure near the 400 Metres, JETWINGS did not respond to his riding and was very disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race over the concluding stages.  He said although JETWINGS had had some time off since its last start, the horse had barrier trialed well in the lead up to todayâs race.  He said based on the horseâs performance in the barrier trial and its subsequent work, he expected JETWINGS to race well today despite the time between runs.  Mr R Gibson, the trainer of JETWINGS, stated that he had given JETWINGS time off since its last run to overcome some minor foot problems.  He said despite the time off, he was very satisfied with the way the horse had trialed in the lead up to todayâs race and he expected it to perform well.  He said, in his opinion, the horseâs disappointing performance could be partly explained by the fact that JETWINGS had to be ridden along in the early stages of the race to make up lost ground due to the poor beginning.  A veterinary inspection of JETWINGS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of JETWINGS, which had been successful at its only two starts in Hong Kong, was considered unacceptable.

Rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, FUN TAPESTRY was awkwardly placed close to the heels of HAYHAY.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HAYHAY, C Y Ho stated that he had been given identical instructions to last start, namely to lead as HAYHAY races best when not having to follow another horse.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode HAYHAY aggressively for a considerable distance in the early stages to prevent KIM GLORY from crossing HAYHAY.  He said despite being vigorously ridden, HAYHAY did not show the same early speed as KIM GLORY and that horse was able to cross HAYHAY making the turn near the 1000 Metres.  He said after being crossed by KIM GLORY, HAYHAY then immediately came off the bridle and despite him continuing to ride the horse along, HAYHAY did not travel and then in the Straight failed to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of HAYHAY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HAYHAY, which was successful at its last start, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HAYHAY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Passing the 600 Metres, PAKISTAN BABY got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of GRACEFUL KINGDOM.  KING DERBY, which was following, was hampered in consequence.
Rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, PAKISTAN BABY was checked away from the heels of GRACEFUL KINGDOM when held up for clear running behind that horse.
Near the 300 Metres, KING DERBY was shifted to the inside of DILLY to obtain clear running after being disappointed for a run outside that horse and inside BRAVE BROTHER.
Passing the 100 Metres, BRAVE BROTHER momentarily raced in restricted room between GRACEFUL KINGDOM and DILLY which shifted out before being corrected by its rider.
Throughout the race, TRAVEL NUMBER ONE raced wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding his riding out of DILLY over the concluding stages, J Moreira stated that near the 75 Metres as his mount was shifting out under pressure, he ceased using the whip and corrected DILLY as BRAVE BROTHER was racing in restricted room to his outside.  He said after straightening DILLY near the 50 Metres, he went to recommence riding the horse out with the whip, however, it became caught between the breast plate and the horseâs neck.  He said as the whip was still wedged under the breast plate, he attempted to extricate the whip so that he could continue to ride DILLY out over the concluding stages, however, he was unable to regather the whip prior to the winning post.  He added however that at all stages he was able to push the horse out with his right hand whilst attempting to regain the use of his whip.
When questioned regarding his riding out of PAKISTAN BABY over the final 50 Metres, D Whyte stated that his mount, when finishing off the race well, got its head on the side and lay in.  He said because of this PAKISTAN BABY was positioned behind LONGWAH AMBER and slightly to the inside of the heels of that horse.  He said whilst he was unaware that a run had developed to the outside of LONGWAH AMBER and inside DILLY approaching the 50 Metres, that run was not available passing the 100 Metres at which time he was committing to the inside of LONGWAH AMBER given that PAKISTAN BABY was laying in.  He added that the manner in which PAKISTAN BABY was laying in would have made it difficult for him to shift to the outside of the heels of LONGWAH AMBER to improve into this run given that it was over the concluding stages of the race.  D Whyte was advised that his failure to attempt to position PAKISTAN BABY to the outside of LONGWAH AMBER over the concluding stages was of concern to the Stewards, however, they were satisfied that his riding did not constitute a breach of the Rules given that the horse was inclined to lay in.  D Whyte was however advised to ensure that he avails himself of runs as they present themselves.
When questioned, Trainer C Fownes stated that he asked C Y Ho to ride MR GINGER in about a midfield position if possible.  He said he had been disappointed with the manner in which MR GINGER had been racing this season and felt that were the horse to be ridden in a forward position tonight from its awkward barrier, it may again not finish off its race.  He said MR GINGER has some issues and he had hoped that it would be able to finish off its races better if ridden more conservatively in the early stages than had previously been the case.  Mr Fownes was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he was reminded of his obligation for horses to be ridden in a consistent manner wherever circumstances allow.
A veterinary inspection of MR GINGER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
DILLY, LONGWAH AMBER and KING DERBY were sent for sampling.

Throughout the race, ANTICIPATION travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Apprentice K C Ng stated that he had been asked to lead on FAT CHOY HONG KONG as that horse had been successful two starts ago when able to dictate the terms of the race.  He said despite being vigorously ridden along in the early stages, TWIN DELIGHT showed more speed than FAT CHOY HONG KONG and as the tempo of the race was strong, he elected to allow that horse to cross FAT CHOY HONG KONG near the 1200 Metres.  He said when TWIN DELIGHT was steadied after obtaining the lead, he shifted FAT CHOY HONG KONG to the outside of that horse and after the 900 Metres was racing beside that horse.  He added when TWIN DELIGHT continued to be steadied and due to FAT CHOY HONG KONG travelling strongly at this time, he was not able to maintain the position slightly behind TWIN DELIGHT which resulted in FAT CHOY HONG KONG improving its position to be racing just in advance of and outside of TWIN DELIGHT.

He said although the tempo of the race in the early stages was not fast, he was reluctant to press forward on RED COURAGE in an attempt to cross TWIN TURBO due to his instructions not to have the horse over-racing and for the fact that he was of the opinion, due to the tempo of the race, the rider of TWIN TURBO would not allow RED COURAGE to cross without him having to make considerable use of it to do so.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of FUN âNâ GAMES, B Prebble stated that he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages to take up a leading position which was similar to how he rode the horse at its most recent start when successful.  He said, despite being aggressively ridden in the early stages, BRILLIANT PROPOSAL showed more speed than FUN âNâ GAMES and was able to cross his mount making the first turn.  He said he was concerned regarding the chances of FUN âNâ GAMES in the early stages as the horse did not travel as strongly as it did at its most recent start.  He added he was obliged to place FUN âNâ GAMES under heavy pressure prior to the Home Turn to maintain its position and shortly after entering the Straight the horse commenced to give ground and over the concluding stages felt âweakâ.  A veterinary inspection of FUN âNâ GAMES immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of FUN âNâ GAMES was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FUN âNâ GAMES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After the race, K C Leung stated that ROYAL SPIRIT did not travel well at any stage of the race and would not stretch out and near the 400 Metres appeared to dip.  He said as he had concerns regarding the horseâs action, he eased it out of the race.  A veterinary inspection of ROYAL SPIRIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of ROYAL SPIRIT, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, ROYAL SPIRIT will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Also after the race, J Moreira (SHADOWFAXE) stated that whilst he had to ride his mount along for some distance in the early stages to cross runners to his inside, nonetheless he was of the opinion that SHADOWFAXE was disappointing in the manner in which it did not close off the race as he expected it would.  He said in the Straight, when placed under pressure, SHADOWFAXE got its head on the side and lay in.  A veterinary inspection of SHADOWFAXE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, SHADOWFAXE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said after being crossed by DOMINEER near the 800 Metres, MASTER KOCHANWONG was then reluctant to maintain its position inside HARBOUR PUNK and for this reason he had to ride the horse along making the turn near the 700 Metres.  He said after the 700 Metres he was required to remain niggling at MASTER KOCHANWONG as the horse continued to be reluctant to maintain its position inside HARBOUR PUNK.  He added in the Straight MASTER KOCHANWONG was disappointing in that it failed to close off the race despite being placed under pressure.  He said, in his opinion, MASTER KOCHANWONG appeared timid when racing inside HARBOUR PUNK which may be as a result of the interference that the horse suffered at its most recent start over the course and distance.

When questioned, N Rawiller (PENNY LANE) stated that in discussions with Mr A T Millard the trainer of PENNY LANE this morning, it had been initially felt that it would be best for the horse to be ridden quietly today due to its wide barrier.  He said Mr Millard expressed disappointment that PENNY LANE was left racing wide and without cover at its most recent start and due to the wide barrier today, it was initially thought that the horse may be left in a similar position.  He said however after further discussing the manner in which the race would likely be run, it had been decided that PENNY LANE may overcome the wide barrier and therefore prior to todayâs race it was decided for PENNY LANE to be ridden in a forward position.  He said however that as the start was effected PENNY LANE did not begin well and as he had to make a prompt decision as to whether to ride the horse forward, he felt that given the manner in which it began, he would have to make too much use of PENNY LANE which was racing over 1600 Metres today and were the horse to be ridden forward, it may be left racing wide or may have to do too much work to lead and therefore would not be able to finish off the race.  After viewing the video of the start, it was established that just prior to the start being effected PENNY LANE lifted its left front leg off the ground and it was for this reason that the horse did not begin well.  After considering this matter, no further action was taken.  A veterinary inspection of PENNY LANE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said as CASH COURIER was not responding to his riding and was giving ground, he eased it down over the concluding stages.  He added after the race there did not appear to be anything significantly amiss with CASH COURIER, therefore he formed the opinion that the horse did not appear to be comfortable on todayâs surface which was loose on top.

BRILLIANT MONKEYS was then checked near the 1000 Metres when unable to maintain its position inside AMBITIOUS GLORY which was racing tight inside KIROV which was being steadied to allow SPURS ON to cross.  Whilst this incident was one of some significance, the Stewards were of the opinion that there were some circumstances which resulted in BRILLIANT MONKEYS having to be checked and accordingly no further action was taken.  However, C K Tong was cautioned regarding continuing to attempt to obtain tight running inside other horses.
J Moreira (HOW SPEEDY) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 950 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of BORN TO WIN, resulting in that horse being taken in onto KIROV which was in turn taken in across the rightful running of AMBITIOUS GLORY which was checked and lost the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  J Moreira was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 11 June 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 31 May 2015.

Near the 1300 Metres, STEP HIGH was momentarily crowded for room inside PROMPT EXPRESS.
Approaching the 1300 Metres, MR VANILLA shifted in and made heavy contact with the running rail of its own accord when momentarily racing tight inside MAC ROW which shifted in marginally when being steadied to allow GREAT TOPLIGHT to cross.  This resulted in MR VANILLA being severely checked and its rider, J Moreira, almost being dislodged.  In this incident, J Moreira lost the use of his left iron for a short distance.

The Stewards considered a protest/objection lodged by B Prebble, the rider of GREAT TOPLIGHT, which finished 2nd, against the winner, ADDOLE, alleging interference to his mount rounding the Home Turn.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the official videos, the Stewards found that just prior to the entrance to the Straight GREAT TOPLIGHT raced tight outside STEP HIGH as Jockey Prebble attempted to prevent STEP HIGH from shifting out.  A short distance later, GREAT TOPLIGHT was shifted out away from the heels of ADDOLE which shifted out.  Having in mind the degree of the interference and that GREAT TOPLIGHT had the length of the Home Straight but was unable to pass ADDOLE, the Stewards could not be comfortably satisfied that had the minor interference not occurred that GREAT TOPLIGHT would have finished in front of ADDOLE and as such the protest/objection was overruled and weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.
STEP HIGH, ADDOLE and GREAT TOPLIGHT were sent for sampling.

When questioned, D Lane stated that it had been intended for HAPPY CHAPPY to be ridden in a forward position as the horse had raced well previously when ridden in this manner and was also ridden similarly in a barrier trial in the lead up to todayâs race.  He said HAPPY CHAPPY began only fairly and it soon became apparent to him that horses drawn inside HAPPY CHAPPY, most notably HIGHLAND HAMMER and PEOPLEâS KNIGHT, were clearly showing more early speed than HAPPY CHAPPY.  He said it was available for him to ride his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position, but having in mind the manner in which it began and the fact that other horses were showing superior early speed, he believed he would have had to make too much use of HAPPY CHAPPY to obtain a forward position and therefore he felt it was more advantageous for the horse to be shifted across in the early stages behind runners to race as close to the outside rail as possible.  He said accordingly he shifted HAPPY CHAPPY across to race behind DRAGON HARMONY passing the 800 Metres which resulted in the horse having to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He added at the 400 Metres he made his finishing run slightly behind the eventual winner NEW ASIA SUNRISE and after initially quickening well, HAPPY CHAPPY then closed off one-paced. 
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HIGHLAND HAMMER, Z Purton stated that today his mount paraded similarly to its previous starts.  He said HIGHLAND HAMMER again showed good early speed to be able to cross the majority of the field and established a position to be racing inside the leader CIRCUIT KING in the early stages.  He said HIGHLAND HAMMER travelled in a similar manner to its previous starts in the early and middle stages, however, today came under pressure near the 400 Metres.  He added as HIGHLAND HAMMER was inclined to lay in, he changed the whip over into his right hand approaching the 300 Metres, however, when placed under pressure, HIGHLAND HAMMER was disappointing in its failure to provide any response and the manner in which it weakened over the concluding stages of the race.  A veterinary inspection of HIGHLAND HAMMER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

                IMPERIAL GALLANTRY was withdrawn on 23.5.15 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (blood abnormality) and was replaced by Standby Declared Starter BE THERE AHEAD (Apprentice K C Ng).  Before being allowed to race again, IMPERIAL GALLANTRY will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
UNIQUE AWESOME and BE THERE AHEAD were slow to begin.
UNIQUE JOYFUL began only fairly and shortly after the start was checked and blundered when crowded for room between FUN TAPESTRY and ISLAND FLYER which shifted out.  After this, UNIQUE JOYFUL was ridden along, however, failed to muster speed and was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
From a wide barrier, UNICORN was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
ELITE PRIDE lost its left front plate at the 1100 Metres and its right front plate at the 450 Metres.
At the 500 Metres, UNICORN was checked away from the heels of MALAYAN PEARL which was steadied away from the heels of WIRE TO WIRE.
ASIA RISING was held up for clear running from the 400 Metres until passing the 300 Metres.
Apprentice C Y Lui (MALAYAN PEARL) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that over the concluding stages he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of BE THERE AHEAD, causing that horse to be checked and to blunder and in turn be taken out onto UNIQUE AWESOME which was also checked when crowded for room out onto the hindquarters of UNIQUE JOYFUL.  Apprentice Lui was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 22 June 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (6 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 31 May 2015.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into consideration the severity of the incident, particularly the interference suffered by BE THERE AHEAD and the fact that this was the 7th occasion this season that Apprentice Lui had been charged with breaching the careless riding Rule.  Apprentice Lui, in the presence of his allocated trainer, Mr P F Yiu, was again told that the Licensing Committee would give consideration to his race riding record when deciding on licences to be issued for the 2015/2016 season and that his race riding record this season is not up to the standard expected of a rider in Hong Kong.  In this incident, UNIQUE JOYFUL (M L Yeung) became unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by UNIQUE AWESOME.  M L Yeung then stopped riding and shifted his mount out in an endeavour to relieve the tightening to the inside of his mount.
Throughout the race, ISLAND FLYER travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Z Purton (UNICORN) stated that, from barrier 13, he was asked to shift the horse across behind runners in the early stages and obtain a position close to the inside rail.  He said he was then asked to ride UNICORN for luck and obtain inside runs in the Straight if possible as the track appeared, up to that point of the meeting, to be favouring horses which were positioned close to the rail.  He said in accordance with his instructions he shifted UNICORN across behind runners in the early stages and was able to obtain a trailing position behind UNIQUE AWESOME on the rail after the 1100 Metres.  He said at the 500 Metres after being awkwardly placed close to the heels of MALAYAN PEARL, he shifted UNICORN to the inside of that horse to improve its position.  He said this was in accordance with his instructions to pursue inside runs if possible.  He added after the 400 Metres he shifted UNICORN to the outside of WIRE TO WIRE in order to attempt to obtain clear running between that horse and ASIA RISING to his outside.  He said after committing to this run, he improved quickly to be racing inside the heels of ASIA RISING which was held up close to the heels of FUN TAPESTRY after the 400 Metres.  He said as HEART WOOD, which was racing in advance of UNICORN and to the inside of ASIA RISING, did not quicken, he was not able to improve his position on UNICORN as he was positioned too far inside ASIA RISING.  He said because of this UNICORN was badly held up for clear running until after the 100 Metres at which time he was able to shift UNICORN to the outside of HEART WOOD when ASIA RISING improved to be racing in advance of that horse.
When questioned regarding the improved performance of HELLO KIMBERLEY, Trainer C S Shum stated that he did not anticipate that HELLO KIMBERLEY would improve as it did in this race.  He said in relation to the horseâs last start at Sha Tin on 9 May 2015, HELLO KIMBERLEY had not previously raced over the course and distance and as the horse had drawn barrier 14 and given that he anticipated there was strong pace in that race, he instructed the rider on that occasion to shift HELLO KIMBERLEY across behind runners in the early stages and obtain a position closer to the rail to see if it could finish off the race.  He said, unlike at its last start where he expected that the race would be run at a strong tempo, he felt there was only one established leader in todayâs race, that being HEART WOOD.  He said having this in mind and given that the track appeared to be favouring horses that were ridden in forward positions and close to the rail, he felt that there was an opportunity for HELLO KIMBERLEY, which was stepping up to 1600 Metres today, to either sit outside HEART WOOD or if the tempo was not strong, to take the lead.
A veterinary inspection of SILVER BAUHINIA, which was eased down after the 600 Metres, immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.  The performance of SILVER BAUHINIA was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SILVER BAUHINIA will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said he had to make a limited amount of use of the horse in the early stages to overcome its moderate start, however, was able to improve to be racing outside the lead.  He said after this SEA RUBY travelled strongly outside the leader RUMBA KING and he expected the horse to again close off the race well given that the tempo of the race in the early stages was not fast.  He added at the entrance to the Straight he placed SEA RUBY under pressure, however, the horse did not quicken as it did at its last start and in fact came under pressure far sooner than he expected.  He said SEA RUBY was very disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding and the manner in which it weakened, particularly over the final 200 Metres.  Trainer J Moore stated that, in his opinion, the horseâs performance tonight could be attributed to the fact that it became very worked up before the race and then had to be used up in the early stages after beginning poorly.  He said SEA RUBY had done particularly well since its last start and based on that performance he expected the horse to be a strong chance in the race.  A veterinary inspection of SEA RUBY immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination revealed the horse to be a âroarerâ.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of OBLITERATOR, D Whyte stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a forward position to overcome its wide barrier.  He said after beginning well he was able to cross runners to his inside and shift in to race outside the early speed with ease.  He added after the 1400 Metres he was able to steady his mount and obtain a trailing position behind MY NAME IS BOND.  He said OBLITERATOR continued to travel comfortably in the middle stages and when MY NAME IS BOND came under pressure after the 600 Metres, he shifted his mount to the outside of that horse and commenced to improve his position into the race.  He said OBLITERATOR went from travelling strongly to coming off the bridle within a number of strides and then despite being ridden out did not respond as he expected.  He said OBLITERATOR was inclined to lay out under pressure in the Straight, however, the horse was already well beaten at this time.  He said whilst OBLITERATOR, which was having its first race start on the All Weather surface, had previously trialed well on that surface when ridden by him, the horse had not been placed under pressure in those trials which was unlike race conditions.  He said, in his opinion, OBLITERATOR has an action which is better suited to racing on turf and he strongly recommended to connections to consider returning the horse to the turf surface having in mind the manner in which OBLITERATOR performed tonight.

He said after obtaining a trailing position, HAPPY KAISER travelled only fairly and after being placed under pressure in the Straight was disappointing in the manner in which it failed to respond to his riding.  He said the only possible explanation he could offer for HAPPY KAISERâs disappointing run was the fact that the horse did not appear to be completely comfortable racing inside other horses.

Near the 75 Metres, HAPPY ROCKY was shifted out away from TURBO JEWELLERY which shifted out marginally under pressure.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to ride HOLMES LEGEND behind midfield from barrier 10 if possible.  He said HOLMES LEGEND began better than expected and he immediately commenced to take hold of his mount in order to shift across behind runners.  He said INDUSTRIALIST WAY, which was drawn immediately inside HOLMES LEGEND, began only fairly and then took a considerable time to muster speed and because of this he was not able to immediately steady HOLMES LEGEND and shift across behind that runner, this resulted in HOLMES LEGEND being left racing in a forward position in the early stages which had not been anticipated.  He added he was also left racing wide passing the winning post on the first occasion and near the 1700 Metres steadied his mount in order to obtain a position behind INDUSTRIALIST WAY.  He said he was not able to bring HOLMES LEGEND back behind that horse prior to SUPREME FRESH improving its position to be racing inside HOLMES LEGEND.  He said therefore he was obliged to let SUPREME FRESH to improve its position and he was able to obtain cover behind that horse after the 1200 Metres but was still left racing wide.  A veterinary inspection of HOLMES LEGEND immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SERGEANT TITANIUM, J Moreira stated that despite being ridden along in the early stages, his mount did not show any early speed and consequently was required to race further back in the field than had been hoped.  He said SERGEANT TITANIUM travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages, however, lost momentum when having to be checked away from the heels of AMBITIOUS CHAMPION after the 700 Metres.  He said it was at this stage that other runners were improving into the race and not being able to improve at this time meant that SERGEANT TITANIUM was going to find it difficult then to finish off the race.  He added SERGEANT TITANIUM gave him a limited response when placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn, however, was disappointing in its failure to close off the race over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of SERGEANT TITANIUM immediately following the race found the horse to have sustained a small wound to the right front leg, however, an endoscopic examination was not able to be conducted due to it being fractious.

When questioned, Apprentice C Y Lui stated that he had been asked to ride PENNY LANE, which was having its first start over 1800 Metres, quietly in the early stages from barrier 10 to have the horse relaxed so that it could see out the distance of todayâs race.  He said after initially failing to show a turn of foot in the early part of the Straight, PENNY LANE, after being ridden towards the rear of the field, then closed off the race quite well over the final 200 Metres.
Also when questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to ensure that ASIA RISING began well and to have the horse positioned in the first five if possible.  He said ASIA RISING had begun only fairly in some of its races and it was stressed to him the need to ensure that the horse began well.  He said he had to ride his mount along in the early stages to ensure that it obtained a forward position as instructed and shifted across to race outside AMBASSADORSHIP.  He said as that horse was going forward of SUPERKING DRAGON, he allowed ASIA RISING to stride forward and obtained an uncontested lead in the early stages rather than continuing to be left racing wide.  He said when WIN ALONG improved to be racing to the outside of ASIA RISING near the 1200 Metres, ASIA RISING commenced to race keenly and would not settle.  He added it was not available at this time to steady his mount to allow WIN ALONG to cross due to the manner in which it was over-racing.

A short distance later, TOUR DE FORCE and KEY WITNESS were crowded for room between DIVINE CALLING (N Rawiller) which shifted out and CHARLES THE GREAT (T Berry) which shifted in when hanging in under pressure.  Both N Rawiller and T Berry were severely reprimanded and advised to ensure that they make every endeavour in similar circumstances to prevent their mounts from shifting ground.  After this, CHARLES THE GREAT continued to hang in under pressure and proved difficult to ride.
Near the 100 Metres, FREDERICK ENGELS was shifted in away from the heels of SMART VOLATILITY.
Also near the 100 Metres, DUNDONNELL was awkwardly placed outside the heels of DOMINEER.
Close to the finishing line, DOMINEER was inconvenienced by EXCITING DREAM which shifted in and consequently was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
Throughout the race, DOMINEER and SMART VOLATILITY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the performance of RAD, D Whyte stated that after obtaining the lead passing the 900 Metres, he attempted to steady the pace, however, when LOVELY DELOVELY improved to his outside, RAD would not settle and he was unable to ease RAD and allowed LOVELY DELOVELY to cross.  He said in the early part of the Straight RAD initially responded well, however, came under pressure after the 300 Metres and then weakened out of the race over the final 200 Metres.  He added that whilst RAD was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened in the Straight, he believed that the horse had some excuses in that it would not settle when taken on in the lead.  A veterinary inspection of RAD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of CHARTER VICTORIA, N Callan stated that after giving his mount a good warm up behind the barriers, he expected it to show more early speed than it subsequently did.  He said he had to make considerable use of CHARTER VICTORIA to obtain a forward position and it was not until after the 1000 Metres that he was able to stop pushing his mount after shifting in to race outside the leader MASSIVE.  He said CHARTER VICTORIA then travelled only fairly and came under pressure after the 500 Metres.  He added despite being ridden out rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, CHARTER VICTORIA did not close off the race and weakened noticeably.  He said after the race he advised connections to consider stepping the horse up in distance in its future starts as it may be able to obtain a forward position without having too much use made of it and may be able to travel more comfortably than it did in tonightâs race.

When questioned, H W Lai stated that he rode SOUTHERN SPRINGS aggressively until passing the winning post on the first occasion in an endeavour to obtain a forward position and then passing the 1200 Metres was left racing in a three wide position.  He said because of the work that he had done earlier on SOUTHERN SPRINGS, he did not feel it was in the best interests of the horse to continue to press forward in an attempt to obtain a position closer to the rail.  He added that after the 1200 Metres he again commenced to ride his mount along, however, it was apparent that SOUTHERN SPRINGS did not have sufficient pace to cross RED COURAGE.

Despite being ridden along in the early stages, DIVINE BOY failed to muster speed.
Making the turn at the 1000 Metres, LONGWAH AMBER commenced to prove very difficult to settle and shifted out away from the heels of DIVINE BOY, despite the efforts of its rider, resulting in WINDICATOR STAR and HO LEE HORSE being badly hampered when crowded for room inside EYE ON YOU which was racing tight to the inside of LEOWL.
In the early stages, LEOWL was left racing very wide and near the 900 Metres was allowed to improve its position to race outside the lead passing the 700 Metres.

When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong (DIVINE BOY) stated that near the 250 Metres he was aware of a gap in advance of DIVINE BOY inside NONE OTHER and to the outside of KYNAM.  He said at this stage he felt this would be the best option to improve rather than shifting to the outside of NONE OTHER.  He said however that near the 150 Metres KYNAM shifted to the outside of YO-YO DA which resulted in the run between that horse and NONE OTHER closing and therefore approaching the 100 Metres he shifted DIVINE BOY to the outside of NONE OTHER after which the horse closed off the race well.  Apprentice Wong was advised that the Stewards were aware that it was his first race ride at Happy Valley, however, in the circumstances, he should have shifted DIVINE BOY to the outside of NONE OTHER near the 250 Metres into clear running which was available.

Shortly after the star, JOLLY POSH and REAL FIT bumped.
From wide barriers, ALL TIMES LUCKY and STEP FASTER were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
BRAVE BROTHER lost its left front plate at the 850 Metres.
Rounding the Hone Turn, FRUITFUL CHAMPION and TOMODACHI raced tight due to KING OF HOUSEHOLD shifting to the outside of REAL FIT into clear running.
Over the concluding stages, BUNKER SHOT raced in restricted room inside REAL FIT which shifted in, resulting in its rider, N Callan, having to stop riding and straighten his mount close to the finishing line.
In the Straight, BUNKER SHOT hung in and proved difficult to ride.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to ride TOMODACHI positively in the early stages and attempt to lead if possible from barrier 11.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode TOMODACHI along, however, the tempo in the early stages was very fast and when a considerable number of horses which were drawn inside TOMODACHI were ridden along to obtain forward positions, TOMODACHI was then not able to show sufficient early speed to be in a position to cross those runners.  He said he did give some thought to steadying TOMODACHI making the turn near the 1000 Metres to take a trailing position behind GOLDEN CHOICE, however, that horse was travelling only fairly and he did not believe that he would be able to steady his mount sufficiently to obtain the position behind that horse.  He added therefore he elected to remain racing to the outside of GOLDEN CHOICE in the hope that the pace would steady after entering the Back Straight.  He said however that due to the make-up of the field, it was not possible for TOMODACHI to improve its position to cross runners to its inside and consequently it was left racing very wide and without cover throughout the race.  After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that TOMODACHI was distressed.  Before being allowed to race again, TOMODACHI will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.  Having in mind TOMODACHIâs previous record of having been distressed following a number of its races, the Stewards will interview Trainer D Cruz regarding this matter prior to the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 7 June 2015.
When questioned regarding his riding of FRUITFUL CHAMPION, Y T Cheng stated that although the horse had been able to lead and race well at its most recent start, he was advised by Mr K L Man, the trainer of FRUITFUL CHAMPION, that it was anticipated that tonightâs race would be run at a fast tempo and therefore he should, if possible, take a trailing position.  He said it was anticipated that REAL FIT, JOLLY POSH and TOMODACHI would all take up leading positions and with JOLLY POSH and REAL FIT being drawn inside FRUITFUL CHAMPION, it was believed that those horses would lead and that FRUITFUL CHAMPION would be able to get a position behind those horses in the early stages.  He said FRUITFUL CHAMPION began very well, however, due to his instructions and having in mind that REAL FIT and JOLLY POSH were being ridden along to his inside, he immediately steadied FRUITFUL CHAMPION in an endeavour to obtain a position behind REAL FIT one horse off the rail.  He added however that FRUITFUL CHAMPION travelled too strongly and he was not able to steady his mount to assume the position behind REAL FIT but having in mind the instruction to attempt to take a trailing position, he interpreted those instructions were that he should not lead on FRUITFUL CHAMPION, therefore he was reluctant to ride his mount along in an endeavour to cross REAL FIT and JOLLY POSH to his inside.  He said this resulted in FRUITFUL CHAMPION racing three wide and without cover throughout the race and consequently weakening in the Straight.  Mr Man stated that although FRUITFUL CHAMPION had led at its last start, he anticipated tonightâs race would be run at a stronger pace and he was concerned that too much use would have to be made of FRUITFUL CHAMPION in the early stages were it to attempt to cross REAL FIT and JOLLY POSH.  He said in a trial prior to being imported into Hong Kong, FRUITFUL CHAMPION had finished strongly when ridden from off the speed and he hoped that the horse would be able to follow REAL FIT throughout the race one horse off the rail.  He said he felt that given that the race would likely be run at a strong tempo, this would provide FRUITFUL CHAMPION with the best opportunity to finish off its race.  Mr Man was advised that he must not give instructions which are so binding as to deter jockeys from resorting to alternate tactics to ensure that horses are given every opportunity to finish off their race.  Y T Cheng was severely reprimanded and advised that irrespective of the instructions given to him by Mr Man, his riding of FRUITFUL CHAMPION lacked judgement and initiative and was not up to the standard expected of a jockey in Hong Kong.  He was advised that having regard to the manner in which his mount began tonight, it was clearly a more preferable option to allow FRUITFUL CHAMPION to stride forward and clear the runners to his inside rather than remain racing in a three wide position and without cover.  He was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are given every opportunity.  A veterinary inspection of FRUITFUL CHAMPION immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, T H So explained that he had been instructed not to be aggressive on TRENDY WORLD in the early stages and endeavour to find a position with cover behind the leading group if possible.  He said at its last start an attempt was made to put TRENDY WORLD on the pace and the horse was not able to display the necessary speed to take up a forward position and consequently proved very disappointing.  He said it was felt that if the horse could be ridden more conservatively and find cover, it may be able to perform better.  He said however that in the run to the first turn when SILVER MISSION and EXCEEDINGLY EXCEL held their positions to his inside, he was left racing very wide and was then obliged to allow TRENDY WORLD to stride forward in an endeavour to find a position closer to the rail.  He added that on the first turn TRENDY WORLD received a bump from EXCEEDINGLY EXCEL and consequently after the 800 Metres he chose to ride TRENDY WORLD forward in an endeavour to cross runners to his inside, however, the horse continued to race very wide and without cover and as a consequence then weakened in the Straight.  Trainer L Ho stated that following discussions with the connections of TRENDY WORLD, it was decided to attempt to ride the horse more conservatively behind the speed rather than attempting to lead as the horse had proved very disappointing of late.  He said however as a consequence of being obliged to race wide, the horse was then not able to close off the race.

He said approaching the 700 Metres when FIVE UP HIGH became awkwardly placed close to the heels of THE SHOW, he allowed the horse to shift out into a three wide position albeit with cover so as to avoid breaking its stride.  He said after giving him a reasonable response in the early part of the Straight, FIVE UP HIGH then came under pressure and proved most disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race.  He added he eased the horse down over the concluding stages as it was no longer in contention and was not striding out fluently.  A veterinary inspection of FIVE UP HIGH immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of FIVE UP HIGH was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FIVE UP HIGH will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, N Callan stated that BOSSIEE raced far too aggressively in the early and middle stages and consequently he had a great deal of difficulty in settling the horse.

N Rawiller was reprimanded and advised that in assessing the incident, the Stewards were cognizant of the fact that MI SAVVY was hanging out and proving difficult to manage, however, he must at all times ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground and causing interference to other runners.
Passing the 300 Metres, TOUCH GO was bumped by EXTREMELY FUN which shifted out away from the heels of JOYFUL THE GREAT which was taken out by PEARL WARM WARM.
Passing the 100 Metres, RUGBY AMBASSADOR was awkwardly placed inside the heels of PEARL WARM WARM.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to ride JOYFUL THE GREAT conservatively due to having drawn the outside barrier.  He said it was explained to him that JOYFUL THE GREAT had previously weakened when ridden in a forward position from a wide alley over the course and distance and therefore it was hoped that tonight the pace of the race would be sufficient that the horse would be able to settle after obtaining cover.  He added after initially getting its head up on a number of occasions when being steadied in the early stages, he was able to shift JOYFUL THE GREAT across to race behind TOUCH GO near the 1000 Metres, however, JOYFUL THE GREAT commenced to prove difficult to settle and had to be shifted out to avoid the heels of that horse after the 1000 Metres.  He said this resulted in JOYFUL THE GREAT racing wide and without cover for the remainder of the race.

After the race, D Whyte stated that the only reason he could offer for the disappointing performance of NAVEL ORANGE was that the horse appeared to be reluctant to stretch out when racing inside other runners.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, Z Purton stated that his mount was inclined to lay in in the early and middle stages which is unusual as the horse has always raced tractably when he had ridden it in the past.  He said when the tempo of the race slackened near the 900 Metres, he intended to ease BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE and commence to improve his position.  He said however that as BACKBENCH BLUES was laying in, the horse was reluctant to shift to the outside of VITAL PRINCE and then got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse after the 900 Metres.  He said when he was able to shift BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE, the horse did not improve into the race as he expected it would and because of this he was then left racing three wide and without cover.  He added BACKBENCH BLUES came under pressure prior to the 600 Metres and despite being ridden vigorously between the 500 Metres and the entrance to the Straight, it did not respond and commenced to give ground.  He said BACKBENCH BLUES pulled up very quickly after the race.  He said he was not able to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance other than to say that it is unusual for the horse to lay in the way that it did.  Mr T P Yung, the trainer of BACKBENCH BLUES, stated that whilst the horse had pleased him in the training in the lead up to tonightâs race, the manner in which it weakened out of the race indicated to him that it may be tired and in need of a let-up.  He said he will monitor the horse in the days to come before discussing the matter with the horseâs owners.  A veterinary inspection of BACKBENCH BLUES immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, a favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.

At the 200 Metres, PAKISTAN BABY was checked away from the heels of MR GINGER which shifted out away from HAPPY METEOR which was taken wider when hampered by JOY LUCK WIN (M L Yeung) which hung out despite the efforts of its rider who at this stage was changing his whip over into his left hand in an attempt to prevent JOY LUCK WIN from continuing to hang out.  Having in mind the racing manners of JOY LUCK WIN, no further action was taken.
Throughout the race, HAPPY METEOR travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that JOY LUCK WIN, which was having its second race start in Hong Kong tonight, commenced to lay out making the turn near the 1000 Metres.  He said on entering the Back Straight JOY LUCK WIN had improved its position in advance of HAPPY BAO BEI to its inside and he attempted to allow JOY LUCK WIN to stride forward to cross HAPPY BAO BEI as he was not sufficiently clear of that horse prior to the 900 Metres.  He said when he allowed JOY LUCK WIN extra rein to improve its position in an attempt to clear HAPPY BAO BEI, the horse got its head on the side and hung out.  He said every time he allowed the horse more rein, it was continually reluctant to shift to the rail and because of this he was not able to cross HAPPY BAO BEI.  He added making the turn after the 600 Metres JOY LUCK WIN continued to lay out and then hung out badly making the Home Turn.  He said in the early part of the Straight he attempted to place JOY LUCK WIN under some pressure, however, the horse continued to hang out badly and for this reason he changed his whip into his left hand near the 200 Metres to see if the horse would respond and race more truly.  He said despite this JOY LUCK WIN continued to hang out for the remainder of the race and as a consequence was not able to be properly tested.  The racing manners of JOY LUCK WIN were considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, JOY LUCK WIN will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial around a bend.
A veterinary inspection of PAKISTAN BABY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
HAPPY BAO BEI and JOY LUCK WIN were sent for sampling.

When questioned, D Lane stated that he had been asked to ride CHEVALIER STAR, which had not been beginning well in its races, in about a midfield position with cover from barrier 12 if possible.  He said CHEVALIER STAR, with blinkers applied for the first time today, began well and after initially steadying his mount in an attempt to comply with his instructions, he felt that, having in mind the way that CHEVALIER STAR began and the make-up of the field to his inside, it would be better to allow his mount to stride forward and clear runners to his inside rather than being left unnecessarily wide and possibly without cover.
Also when questioned, N Rawiller (AH BO) stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a similar position to last start and that was in midfield or just in advance of midfield with cover if possible.  He said AH BO began only fairly and due to the make-up of the field in the early stages, he was not able to shift in to obtain a positon closer to the rail than four wide.  He said making the first turn when the pace of the race slowed appreciably, he did give consideration to allowing AH BO to stride forward, however, he felt that he would have had to make a lot of use of AH BO to improve its position at this time and it was likely that the pace of the race would increase which would result in AH BO still having to race wide.  He said therefore he felt that his better option was to keep AH BO balanced albeit wide.  He added after the 600 Metres AH BO got its head on the side and lay out and then in the Straight gave ground.

D Lane is currently due to commence a suspension incurred at the Happy Valley racemeeting last Wednesday, 10 June 2015 on Monday, 15 June 2015 which is to expire on Thursday, 25 June 2015 on which day he may resume race riding.
At the 200 Metres, JUST PLEASANT and SHOWHOOVES were crowded for room inside BEAR-POP which was taken in by HELLO KIMBERLEY which, when weakening, got its head on the side and shifted in away from HAPPY PLACE which hung in under pressure and proved difficult to ride.  HAPPY PLACE continued to hang in under pressure for the remainder of the race.
The performance of THIS IS GLADIATOR, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, THE IS GLADIATOR will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong (BORN TO WIN) stated that he had been instructed to lead if possible, however, if the rider of another horse was intent on leading, he should hand up the lead and obtain a trailing position.  He said after initially racing to the outside of SNOWHOOVES in the early stages, he allowed BORN TO WIN to improve its position into the lead when that horse was steadied after the 1400 Metres.  He said in the middle stages he was aware that BORN TO WIN had established something of a margin over the remainder of the field, however, he felt that the tempo of the race was not overly strong and as he had not ridden the horse along in the early stages to obtain the lead, he did not believe he was going too quickly on the horse.  After being made aware of the sectional times between the 1200 Metres and the 400 Metres, Apprentice Wong agreed that the tempo of the race at this time was faster than he thought and that he should have made a far greater effort to steady the tempo to allow BORN TO WIN the opportunity to close off the race.  Apprentice Wong was told to ensure that, wherever possible, he does not set such a tempo on his mounts that they are then not able to finish off their race.
After the race, J Moreira stated that after being able to obtain a good position on BEAR-POP in midfield with cover, the horse was then disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding when asked rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight.  He said after momentarily racing tight near the 200 Metres, BEAR-POP was particularly disappointing in the manner in which it weakened over the latter stages of the race.  A veterinary inspection of BEAR-POP immediately following the race did not show any significant findings  The performance of BEAR-POP, a winner of its last two starts, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BEAR-POP will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said whilst NOT LISTENINâTOME did quicken well in the early part of the Straight, it did not show a sufficient turn of foot to be able to improve its position on the winner SECRET SHAM in the Straight.  He added whilst NOT LISTENINâTOME appeared disappointing, he felt that the tempo of the race did not suit the horse as, in his opinion, it is better when able to sit behind a more genuine tempo.  A veterinary inspection of NOT LISTENINâTOME including an endoscopic examination immediately following the race revealed the horse to have inflamed laryngeal cartilages.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HARBOUR ALERT, D Whyte stated that his mount travelled too keenly in the early and middles stages and would not settle when racing inside WINFULL PATROL.  He said nonetheless HARBOUR ALERT was disappointing in that it came under pressure after the 500 Metres to maintain its position inside WINFULL PATROL when that horse quickened.  He added HARBOUR ALERT did not respond to his riding passing the 300 Metres and was particularly disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race over the final 200 Metres.

In the middle stages, SPARKLING SWORD raced with its head on the side.
In the Straight, GREAT TOPLIGHT got its head on the side and lay in under pressure.
When questioned, C Y Ho stated that he had been asked to ride COOL BEAN in the first three if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages in an attempt to cross MAZANDARAN to his inside.  He said approaching and passing the winning post on the first occasion when being crossed by SPARKLING SWORD, he still believed that COOL BEAN may be able to cross MAZANDARAN, however, MIGHTY WONGCHOY, which was shifting in from outside COOL BEAN, showed more early speed than COOL BEAN at this time and was able to shift in to cross COOL BEAN after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said as MIGHTY WONGCHOY had shifted in to a position one horse outside the leader SPARKLING SWORD, it was no longer available for him to clear MAZANDARAN and therefore he steadied his mount in order to take a trailing position behind that horse.  He added however that at this time GREAT TOPLIGHT was able to shift across from a wide draw to establish the position behind MAZANDARAN and this resulted in COOL BEAN being left racing wide and without cover for the remainder of the race.
When questioned, T H So stated that rounding the Home Turn it had been his intention to try and shift to the outside to obtain clear running on RISING POWER.  He said however that at the entrance to the Straight RISING POWER was positioned to the inside of COOL BEAN and because of this he was not able to continue shifting out without having to unnecessarily steady his mount which would have been detrimental to the horseâs chances.  He said as there was considerable room more to the inside, he elected immediately to shift in away from the heels of PLAIN BLUE BANNER and obtain clear running.  He said after being shifted in across the heels of initially ISLAND FLYER and then ONE OF A KIND, RISING POWER commenced to finish off the race strongly.  He added passing the 100 Metres he was faced with the option of improving to the inside of LIGHTNING PEGASUS or to the outside of that horse where a run existed between LIGHTNING PEGASUS and SPARKLING SWORD.  He said as the rider of LIGHTNING PEGASUS was using the whip in the left hand, he felt that it may be a better option to pursue the run to the outside of that horse and inside SPARKLING SWORD in the event LIGHTNING PEGASUS shifted in which would impede his running were he attempt to improve to the inside of that horse.  He said near the 50 Metres SPARKLING SWORD shifted in marginally under pressure which resulted in the gap between LIGHTNING PEGASUS and SPARKLING SWORD reducing and for this reason he switched RISING POWER in abruptly away from the heels of LIGHTNING PEGASUS.  He added close to the finishing line RISING POWER then raced tight inside LIGHTNING PEGASUS which shifted in.  As the Stewards were satisfied that at the time that Jockey So elected to commit to the run to the outside of LIGHTNING PEGASUS, it was reasonable for him to have done so given that there was similar room available to both inside and outside LIGHTNING PEGASUS.  As such, no further action was taken.

When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he had been instructed to take up a forward position if possible on OUR FOLKS which was having its first start at Happy Valley tonight.  He said after beginning well he rode his mount along in the early stages in an attempt to carry out his instructions.  He said despite being vigorously ridden for the first 200 Metres of the race, OUR FOLKS did not respond to his riding and rather than improving its position gave ground making the turn near the 1000 Metres.  He said on entering the Back Straight he was aware that FANTASTIC FEELING was attempting to shift in in front of OUR FOLKS, however, after riding the horse aggressively until after the 1000 Metres, he did not believe that it was in the best interests of OUR FOLKS to continue riding the horse forward in an attempt to prevent FANTASTIC FEELING from shifting in and therefore that horse was able to obtain a position in front of OUR FOLKS near the 800 Metres.  He added after racing behind FANTASTIC FEELING, he had RUBY COAST racing directly to his outside.  He said when he was aware that that horse was improving its position in order to shift in in front of OUR FOLKS, he rode his mount along approaching and passing the 700 Metres in an attempt to prevent RUBY COAST from shifting in.  He said despite being ridden along at this time OUR FOLKS again did not respond and for this reason RUBY COAST was then able to shift in in front of OUR FOLKS near the 600 Metres which resulted in OUR FOLKS racing much further back in the field than had been intended.  He added he placed OUR FOLKS under pressure prior to the Home Turn, however, the horse raced disappointingly.  After viewing the videos, the Stewards accepted Apprentice Wongâs evidence and took no further action.  A veterinary inspection of OUR FOLKS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
After the race, T H So expressed concern regarding the action of FLYING ELITE.  A veterinary inspection of FLYING ELITE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said JETWINGS was able to recover from this by obtaining a position just worse than midfield.  He said JETWINGS travelled satisfactorily whilst on the bridle, however, after being asked for an effort rounding the Home Turn JETWINGS did not appear to be comfortable in its action and, in his opinion, did not handle todayâs track surface.

When questioned, Z Purton stated that it had been intended for FISH Nâ CHIPS to be ridden in a midfield position if possible as the horse had previously not finished off its races when ridden in a forward position on turf.  He said FISH Nâ CHIPS began only fairly today and due to a considerable number of horses being ridden along in the early stages from better draws, he steadied FISH Nâ CHIPS and shifted the horse across behind runners to obtain cover.  He said this resulted in FISH Nâ CHIPS having to race slightly further back in the field than had been hoped.

When questioned, W M Lai stated that it had been agreed that GLORY SUNSHINE should be ridden in a forward position.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages, however, TEN FLAMES was also vigorously ridden to maintain its position to the inside of GLORY SUNSHINE.  He said he continued to ride GLORY SUNSHINE along, however, the horse showed insufficient pace to be able to establish a margin over TEN FLAMES and therefore after the 1000 Metres he desisted in riding his mount along as he believed that he would have had to make too much use of GLORY SUNSHINE to attempt to obtain the lead when the horse was not showing sufficient natural speed.  He said this resulted in GLORY SUNSHINE racing in a three wide position without cover throughout the race outside TEN FLAMES.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of ROUGE ET BLANC, Z Purton stated that the horse did not travel at any stage of the race.  He said he had intended to maintain a position inside COUP DâETAT in the early stages of the race, however, ROUGE ET BLANC was not travelling well enough to maintain this position, therefore he attempted to balance the horse and obtain a trailing position behind COUP DâETAT rather than to have it racing off the bridle in an attempt to establish its position.  He added ROUGE ET BLANC came under pressure well prior to the Home Turn and then did not respond to his riding at any stage in the Straight.  He said ROUGE ET BLANC did not feel comfortable in todayâs track conditions and this, in his opinion, explained the disappointing performance of the horse.

When questioned, T H So stated that he had been asked to have BAAB AL NASR travelling where it was comfortable and to obtain cover if it was at all possible.  He said in the early stages he steadied BAAB AL NASR in an attempt to obtain a trailing position behind GRACEFUL KINGDOM.  He said however that due to the circumstances of the race in the early stages, particularly KIRAM being ridden along to maintain its position, he was left racing wide and without cover after the 800 Metres.  He said when GENEROUS BOBO was allowed to improve its position forward of his mount near the 900 Metres, he promptly attempted to steady BAAB AL NASR as he was aware that he would be able to obtain a trailing position behind that horse.  He added however that when GENEROUS BOBO improved around his mount, BAAB AL NASR commenced to travel strongly and he was not able to immediately get the horse to relax and take a trailing position.  He said he continued to steady BAAB AL NASR and was eventually able to obtain a trailing position behind GENEROUS BOBO after the 700 Metres.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MULTIMAX, Apprentice K C Ng stated that his mount was not favoured by being challenged by a number of runners racing to his outside in the early and middle stages.  He said despite this MULTIMAX commenced to travel satisfactorily in the middle stages, however, came under pressure near the 500 Metres to maintain its positon.  He added this is unusual for MULTIMAX as it does not usually come under pressure after entering the Home Straight.  He said MULTIMAX initially quickened well in the early part of the Straight, however, near the 300 Metres commenced to give ground and then weakened over the concluding stages.  He added the manner in which MULTIMAX failed to close off the race indicated to him that the horse did not handle the track conditions.

When questioned regarding the performance of SWEET BEAN, Z Purton stated that due to the good tempo of the race SWEET BEAN was never able to travel comfortably.  He said he holds some reservations as to whether SWEET BEAN is effective at the 2200 Metres and the tempo of the race did not enable him to give the horse a comfortable run to see out the distance.  He said he attempted to shift to the outside of EVER SHINY near the 500 Metres, however, SWEET BEAN was not travelling well enough to improve at this time and this allowed MOBILE KING to improve around SWEET BEAN.  He added whilst his mount was awkwardly placed close to the heels of EVER SHINY near the 400 Metres, the horse was already under pressure and in the Straight did not respond to his riding.

The Stewards considered a protest/objection lodged by B Prebble, the rider of FABIO, which finished second, against TOP BONUS being declared the winner alleging interference to his mount near the 150 Metres.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the official videos, the Stewards found that at about the 150 Metres FABIO and TOP BONUS made contact due to both horses shifting ground.

He said when the tempo of the race slackened near the 1200 Metres, he considered allowing his mount to stride forward, however, at this time he became aware that LEOWL was being shifted out away from the rail to race outside and behind the leader in a one-off position and he felt that had he allowed VARA PEARL to stride forward at this time, he would have had to make considerable use of the horse to avoid having to remain in a three wide position.  He added he did not believe it would be in the best interests of VARA PEARL to do so at this time and therefore he elected to keep his horse balanced albeit in a three wide position without cover.

Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, CHATER LEGEND was crowded for room between SELKIRK STAR and MARVEL TRIBE (N Callan) which shifted in before being directed out to relieve the tightening to CHATER LEGEND.  The Stewards found that after having initially been clear of CHATER LEGEND when MARVEL TRIBE commenced to shift in, CHATER LEGEND then improved quickly to be racing to the inside of the heels of that horse.  N Callan was advised that whilst there were some circumstances to this incident, nonetheless he must ensure that he takes all available measures to establish whether he is clear of other runners prior to shifting ground in similar circumstances.
Due to the slow tempo, GOODHEART SUCCESS was allowed to stride forward passing the 1100 Metres to race outside the lead.
Making the first turn after the 1100 Metres, SELKIRK STAR shifted out and was awkwardly placed inside the heels of BULLISH BOY.

BULLISH BOY lost its right hind plate at the 400 Metres and its left front plate after passing the winning post.
When questioned regarding his riding of BULLISH BOY, G Mosse stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 8, to obtain a position behind the leaders with cover if possible as BULLISH BOY had raced successfully when ridden in this manner from a more favourable barrier at its most recent start.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion he attempted to shift in behind TRENDY WIN when that horse improved to race outside the lead, however, SELKIRK STAR improved its position to be racing just to the inside of the heels of BULLISH BOY.  He said he continued to place some pressure on SELKIRK STAR approaching and passing the 1200 Metres to establish whether he could position BULLISH BOY behind TRENDY WIN and in front of SELKIRK STAR, however, SELKIRK STAR continued to maintain its position.  He said at this time BULLISH BOY was travelling only fairly and as SELKIRK STAR did not fully establish itself inside BULLISH BOY, he continued to pursue the option of obtaining a trailing position behind TRENDY WIN for some distance after the 1200 Metres.  He said however that when that horse maintained its position, he was left racing in a three wide position without cover and near the 1000 Metres GOODHEART SUCCESS rapidly improved around BULLISH BOY to race in a forward position.  He said after this BULLISH BOY continued to race wide and without cover and then came under pressure well before the Home Turn and did not finish off the race.  He added that he noted after the race BULLISH BOY had lost its left front and right hind plates which may have affected the horseâs ability to finish off the race.  G Mosse was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that he had attempted to carry out his instructions approaching and passing the 1200 Metres, when it became apparent that BULLISH BOY would not be able to obtain cover behind TRENDY WIN and given the tempo of the race at the relevant time, he should have made an effort to allow BULLISH BOY to improve its position rather than continue to race wide and without cover.  G Mosse was further advised to ensure that, wherever circumstances allow, he should avoid covering unnecessary ground.

After the race, B Prebble (VICTORY DUKE) reported that the horse, which sweated up badly in the Parade Ring, was very stirred up and became fractious in the barriers and may have made contact with the front gates.  He said, in his opinion, these circumstances would account for the horseâs disappointing performance.  A veterinary inspection of VICTORY DUKE immediately following the race found blood to be present at the mouth due to a loose incisor tooth, however, this was unlikely to be of significance.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that, from barrier 12, it was felt that BEST TANGO would get too far out of its ground were the horse to be restrained in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.  He said it was felt that the race would not be run at a fast tempo and therefore he was asked to obtain a position in about 5th or 6th with cover if possible.  He said in the early stages it appeared as though he would be able to obtain this position, however, ENORMOUS HONOUR, which was racing to his inside, maintained its position one horse off the rail rather than shifting over towards the rail and this resulted in BEST TANGO being left in a position three wide and without cover after the 1300 Metres.  He added after this the pace of the race steadied and rather than continue to race unnecessarily wide, he allowed the horse to improve its position into the lead.  He said he was able to steady the tempo on BEST TANGO in the middle stages, however, the horse came under pressure in the Straight and then did not finish off the race.

Consequently BEAUTY JOURNEY was not able to be properly ridden out right to the end of the race.
Throughout the race, MASQUERADER travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, H W Lai (SNOW SLIDER) stated that he had to make considerable use of his horse in the early stages to obtain a forward position and because of SNOW SLIDERâs reluctance to show speed in the early stages, he was not able to lead.  He said after the 1200 Metres he obtained a trailing position behind the eventual winner THE SHOW one horse off the rail.  He said SNOW SLIDER travelled comfortably until near the 600 Metres at which time the horse commenced to travel keenly and was awkwardly placed close to the heels of THE SHOW.  He said given SNOW SLIDERâs history of wanting to shift to the outside of the track in some of its previous races when taken hold of by its rider, he was reluctant to steady SNOW SLIDER in an attempt to remain racing behind THE SHOW even though this was his preference given that it was at the 600 Metres.  He added he felt that, having regard to SNOW SLIDERâS previous history, it was better to allow it to improve in a three wide position around THE SHOW rather than risk having the horse not respond comfortably to being restrained and getting off the track.  He said this resulted in SNOW SLIDER having to make its finishing run sooner than he had hoped.
After the race, K C Leung was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of THANKSGIVING.  He said the horse travelled comfortably in the lead inside the eventual winner THE SHOW, however, came under pressure at the entrance to the Straight and then did not respond to his riding thereafter.  A veterinary inspection of THANKSGIVING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
ROYALE ELEGANCE, THE SHOW and BEAUTY JOURNEY were sent for sampling.

                HELLO KIMBERLEY was withdrawn on 30.6.15 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (lame right fore) and was replaced by Standby Declared Starter RISING POWER (W M Lai).  Before being allowed to race again, HELLO KIMBERLEY will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
RISING POWER was crowded for room on jumping between WINNING APEX which began awkwardly and DASHING SUPER which shifted in.
SUPERKING DRAGON and DIAMOND FRIENDS bumped on jumping.
From a wide barrier, WINNING MASCOT was steadied shortly after the start and shifted across behind runners.
Making the first turn after the winning post on the first occasion, DIAMOND FRIENDS and WINNING APEX raced tight inside DASHING SUPER (M L Yeung) which got its head on the side and hung in despite the efforts of its rider.  In this incident, WINNING APEX was steadied when no longer able to maintain its position between DIAMOND FRIENDS and DASHING SUPER.  As the Stewards were satisfied that M L Yeung had taken all reasonable measures to prevent DASHING SUPER from shifting in, no further action was taken.
Passing the 1400 Metres, RISING POWER commenced to prove very difficult to settle and got its head up when being checked away from the heels of WINNING APEX.
For some distance after the 1000 Metres, LUCKY PLACE proved very difficult to settle and was checked away from the heels of ATOMIC BLAST.  Then after the 900 Metres, LUCKY PLACE shifted out away from the heels of ATOMIC BLAST, resulting in HAPPY MOMENTS being taken wider.  LUCKY PLACE continued to travel keenly and improved its position around ATOMIC BLAST after the 700 Metres.
At the entrance to the Straight, SUPERKING DRAGON was awkwardly placed outside the heels of DASHING SUPER.
HURRY HURRY UP was held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight when unable to obtain clear running behind EN CIVIL which was giving ground.
Throughout the race, HAPPY MOMENTS travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that as there appeared to be considerable pace in the race, it was decided for SUPERKING DRAGON to be ridden in about a midfield position if possible.  He said after passing the winning post on the first occasion he had to steady SUPERKING DRAGON due to runners to his outside crossing to shift in towards the rail.  He said had he have attempted to maintain his position at this time, SUPERKING DRAGON would likely have met with interference and therefore the horse was obliged to race one spot further back in the field than had been intended.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of EN CIVIL, Z Purton, who had not previously ridden the horse, stated that whilst he had to make some use of EN CIVIL to cross the field from the outside barrier, it was able to relax satisfactorily in the middle stages.  He said although the pace of the race was solid, the track appeared to be riding fast and he did not believe that the tempo he set on the horse provided an excuse for the manner in which EN CIVIL came under pressure rounding the Home Turn.  He said despite being placed under pressure after the 400 Metres, EN CIVIL did not respond to his riding and weakened out of the race noticeably in the early part of the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of EN CIVIL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of EN CIVIL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, EN CIVIL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of RISING POWER immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, RISING POWER will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said shortly after the start he was able to shift to the outside rail when GIDDY GIDDY did not begin well, however, he became concerned regarding the manner in which SIR JOHN was travelling after a short distance in that it was not on the bridle as it had been in the early stages in the majority of its races.  He said SIR JOHN never travelled comfortably in the race and was inclined to lay in which is not a common trait for the horse when he had ridden it in both races and in track work.  He added whilst SIR JOHN did not weaken noticeably, nonetheless the horse failed to let down and finished off the race only fairly.  He said the manner in which SIR JOHN failed to stretch out comfortably in the race indicated to him that the horse may have a veterinary issue.

When questioned, A Suborics stated that due to having drawn barrier 4 and because of the expected fast pace in the race from a number of horses which were drawn to his outside, he had been asked to shift WINFULL PATROL across in the early stages and obtain cover.  He said it was felt that it was more advantageous for the horse to be ridden this way and possibly find the line rather than having to be used up in the early stages to overcome the awkward draw and not being able to finish off the race.  He said WINFULL PATROL responded to being ridden in this manner and finished off the race strongly.

When questioned, M Chadwick stated that in pre-race discussions with Mr D E Ferraris, the trainer of MR VANILLA, it was felt that tonightâs race would be run at a slow tempo as the race appeared to lack any established leaders.  He said as MR VANILLA had generally begun well in its races in the past, it was felt that there was an opportunity for it to obtain a forward position without having to have too much use made of it.  He said it was hoped that he would be able to steady MR VANILLA and allow a number of runners to improve around that horse which would provide MR VANILLA the opportunity to race with cover.  He said after beginning very well, MR VANILLA then did not show natural early speed and he had to make some use of the horse to obtain a forward position.  He said despite being ridden along MR VANILLA was not able to cross a number of runners to its inside and therefore, after passing the winning post on the first occasion, he steadied MR VANILLA in an endeavour to possibly obtain a position with cover further back in the field.  He added MR VANILLA did not travel well at any stage of the race and came under pressure after the 800 Metres and then continued to give ground. 
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of LIGHTNING PEGASUS, A Suborics stated that from the horseâs good barrier he was able to obtain a position behind the leader GREAT TOPLIGHT without having to be ridden along at any stage.  He said LIGHTNING PEGASUS travelled very well and rounding the Home Turn continued to travel strongly and he anticipated the horse would finish off the race well as it did at its most recent start when successful.  He added shortly after entering the Straight a tight run appeared between GREAT TOPLIGHT and MIGHTY WONGCHOY but despite being ridden along, LIGHTNING PEGASUS was reluctant to improve into the tight run between those horses.  He said because of this LIGHTNING PEGASUS was not able to take advantage of this run prior to MIGHTY WONGCHOY shifting in after the 300 Metres.  He said he then shifted LIGHTING PEGASUS out to take advantage of a run to the outside of MIGHTY WONGCHOY and inside MEDIC SWORDSMAN passing the 200 Metres, however, once again LIGHTNING PEGASUS was reluctant to quicken into the tight running and because of this was again disappointed for running.  He said after this, despite being placed under pressure, LIGHTNING PEGASUS did not quicken and was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of LIGHTNING PEGASUS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of LIGHTNING PEGASUS, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LIGHTNING PEGASUS will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Approaching the 1300 Metres, STRONG FOUNDATION and MEDALLIST raced tight inside SEMPITERNAL which was awkwardly placed inside the heels of GREAT CHARM.
Near the 950 Metres, AMAZINGLY got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of STRONG FOUNDATION.  ALBICELESTE, which was following, was hampered in consequence.
Also near the 950 Metres, ROYAL PARTNER was steadied away from the heels of MEDALLIST which was being steadied to allow SEMPITERNAL to cross.  INDUSTRIALIST WAY, which was following, was hampered in consequence.  For some distance after this, INDUSTRIALIST WAY continued to be awkwardly placed behind ROYAL PARTNER which continued to race close to the heels of MEDALLIST.

JOLLY VICTOR lost its left front plate approaching the 800 Metres.
Passing the 500 Metres, MEDALLIST was awkwardly placed inside JOLLY VICTOR which lay in.
When questioned regarding his riding of SEMPITERNAL, N Rawiller stated that he had been instructed to lead if possible as SEMPITERNAL had raced well when ridden in this manner in the past and there did not appear to be any other established leaders in the race.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode SEMPITERNAL along in the early stages, however, the horse did not show the early speed that he expected and shortly after the start commenced to hang in.  He said he continued to ride his mount along, however, the more he rode the horse, the more it was inclined to hang in.  He said the pace of the race in the early stages was much stronger than anticipated and having in mind SEMPITERNAL did not show natural early speed and was hanging in, he did not believe it was reasonable, given the tempo of the race, to continue riding his mount along.  He said it was also pertinent that STRONG FOUNDATION and MEDALLIST were being ridden along to maintain their positions inside SEMPITERNAL.  He said when GREAT CHARM improved its way around SEMPITERNAL passing the winning post on the first occasion, this ensured that the tempo of the race continued to be strong and he felt it was not in the best interests of the horse for him to continue to ride it along.  He added he anticipated that once GREAT CHARM was able to lead, the tempo of the race would slacken which it did after the 1200 Metres.  He said when this occurred he allowed SEMPITERNAL to improve its way forward of MEDALLIST and he was able to shift SEMPITERNAL to race outside GREAT CHARM after the 1000 Metres.  He said after obtaining this position SEMPITERNAL travelled well and he was content to remain racing outside GREAT CHARM.  He said however that at the 700 Metres FLYING CHAPARRAL improved around SEMPITERNAL and whilst he did give consideration to improving at this time to prevent that horse from crossing into the lead, he did not believe that this would be in the best interests of SEMPITERNAL given that had occurred early in the race.  He added he did not believe that commencing his finishing run from the 700 Metres would allow SEMPITERNAL the opportunity to finish off the race having in mind the fast early sectionals of the race.  He said for this reason he allowed FLYING CHAPARRAL to continue forward of SEMPITERNAL and permitted WILLIE INVICTUS to improve around his horse near the 500 Metres.  He said he commenced to ride his mount along when the pace of the race increased approaching the 400 Metres and SEMPITERNAL, given the circumstances of the race, finished off the race quite well.  After having considered the sectionals of the race in particular from the start until the 1200 Metres and after having considered N Rawillerâs explanation, the Stewards took no further action.
After the race, T H So (INDUSTRIALIST WAY) said his mount did not travel well throughout the race and when the pace increased after the 500 Metres, INDUSTRIALIST WAY was left flat-footed and then did not finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of INDUSTRIALIST WAY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

The declaration of weighed-in was deferred whilst the Stewards considered an application by N Callan, the rider of BOTH LUCKY, and Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of that horse, that BOTH LUCKY be declared a non-runner due to an incident at the start.  After taking evidence from Jockey Callan, Mr Yiu and Mr T McGovern, Starter and after viewing the official videos, the Stewards found that simultaneously with the start being effected BOTH LUCKY reared, resulting in the horse losing a considerable amount of ground.  The Stewards found that during this incident a starting gate handler was attempting to assist Jockey Callan and BOTH LUCKY and at no stage did that starting gate handler prevent BOTH LUCKY from being afforded a fair start.  As the Stewards formed the opinion that BOTH LUCKY had been afforded a fair start, the horse was deemed to be a runner.  Before being allowed to race again, BOTH LUCKY will be required to perform satisfactorily in an official barrier trial.
When questioned regarding the performance of SO FAST, J Moreira stated that his mount, which was having only its second race start in Hong Kong today, raced greenly throughout.  He said after being crossed by GENTILIS making the first turn, SO FAST was inclined to shift ground on a number of occasions and did not race as truly as he had hoped.  He said rounding the Home Turn SO FAST was reluctant to maintain its position when racing in restricted room between SENSATION and GENTILIS which got its head on the side and lay out.  He said for this reason he shifted SO FAST to the outside of SENSATION to make its finishing run.  He added in the early part of the Straight SO FAST was left flat-footed and near the 200 Metres was awkwardly placed when racing close to the heels of SENSATION due to both horses shifting ground.  He said after this, in his opinion, SO FAST finished off the race quite well and would be improved by todayâs race given that it is relatively immature at this time.  A veterinary inspection of SO FAST immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horseâs trachea.

He said ELEGANT FRAMES was under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn and despite being ridden out did not respond and was very disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race in the Straight.  Mr T K Ng, the trainer of ELEGANT FRAMES, stated that the horse had not required a barrier trial in the lead up to today's race as it had raced all the way to the end of the most recent season.  He said he was happy with the horse's fitness leading into today's race and that it had worked well.  He said after being able to obtain a good position throughout the race, he was disappointed with the manner in which the horse came under pressure before the Home Turn and then did not respond to riding in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of ELEGANT FRAMES immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of ELEGANT FRAMES was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, ELEGANT FRAMES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

For the majority of the race, PERFECT TRIUMPH travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding his riding of FOREST COLOURS in the Straight, Y T Cheng stated that in the early part of the Straight FOREST COLOURS hung in and after the 400 Metres bumped SOUTHCHINA COMMAND.  He said FOREST COLOURS continued to lay in and proved difficult to ride and as he was concerned that SOUTHCHINA COMMAND remained racing to his inside, he was reluctant to fully test FOREST COLOURS as he was concerned that to have done so would likely cause interference to that runner.  He added he rode FOREST COLOURS out strongly hands and heels until the 200 Metres at which time he commenced to use the whip on the horse, however, FOREST COLOURS continued to race with its head on the side and for this reason he stopped using the whip and rode his mount out strongly hands and heels all the way to the end of the race.  Y T Cheng was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that FOREST COLOURS lay in in the early part of the Straight, resulting in contact being made between that horse and SOUTHCHINA COMMAND, nonetheless his riding out, particularly over the final 300 Metres, caused the Stewards concern.  He was further advised that he must make every endeavour to test his mounts out even under difficult circumstances so as to ensure that his riding is not able to be questioned.  Y T Cheng was advised that his riding out in the latter part of the Straight had come under notice.
The Stewards questioned C Schofield, the rider of the 3rd placegetter, GOLDWEAVER, regarding his riding out of that horse close to the finishing line.  After taking evidence from C Schofield and after viewing the official videos, the Stewards advised C Schofield that they could not be comfortably satisfied that his riding out of GOLDWEAVER close to the winning post had cost that horse 2nd placing.  In arriving at this decision, the Stewards took into consideration the manner in which FRIENDS OF YAN OI, the 2nd placegetter, was finishing off the race and that C Schofield had eased his riding of the horse within the final stride of the race.  C Schofield was advised that whilst he was being given the benefit of the doubt in respect of this matter given that the Stewards could not be satisfied to the requisite degree that his riding out of the horse over the concluding stages had prevented that horse from finishing 2nd, he was severely reprimanded and advised of the significance of the Rule requiring riders to ride their mounts out all the way to the end of the race to the satisfaction of the Stewards and of the significant penalty which necessarily attaches to a breach of this Rule.

From a wide barrier, LUCKY CELEBRITY was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
SMART DECLARATION lost its right front plate after the line.
When questioned, C Schofield stated that he had been instructed to ride FREE NOVEMBER more conservatively as the horse had not been finishing off its races last season when being ridden along to obtain a forward position.  He said with CALIFORNIA BOUNTY and SMART DECLARATION being drawn to the inside of FREE NOVEMBER, it was anticipated that he would be able to allow those horses to improve forward of FREE NOVEMBER in order to obtain a trailing position behind them.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he steadied FREE NOVEMBER in the early stages and commenced to shift across behind SMART DECLARATION, however, FREE NOVEMBER dropped the bit more than he had anticipated and, despite then being niggled along, got further out of its ground than had been intended.  He added he was aware that the rider of STINGER, which was positioned to the outside of FREE NOVEMBER, was riding his mount along and he did not believe it was in the best interests of FREE NOVEMBER to ride it aggressively at this time to prevent STINGER from shifting in as it had been explained to him that the horse had over-raced on occasions during its racing career.  He said therefore he elected to obtain a trailing positon behind STINGER.  He said he continued to follow STINGER throughout the middle stages and when it shifted out approaching the Home Turn, he improved to the inside of STINGER and commenced to ride his mount along after which the horse closed off the race well.  C Schofield was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, in the opinion of the Stewards, there was an opportunity for him to maintain his position inside STINGER along the Back Straight without having to ride his mount aggressively to do so.  The Stewards also advised C Schofield that, in their opinion, he should have commenced to ride his mount sooner to improve into the race.  C Schofield was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they do not get too far out of their ground.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SUPER ABUNDANTE, Y T Cheng stated that he was able to obtain a forward position in the early stages after which the horse travelled very well.  He said although SUPER ABUNDANTE was taken into a three wide position near the 450 Metres when CALIFORNIA BOUNTY shifted away from the rail, he was not concerned by this as SUPER ABUNDANTE was still travelling well.  He added however that after he placed the horse under pressure passing the 400 Metres, SUPER ABUNDANTE did not quicken as he expected and he had to ride it along rounding the Home Turn.  He said shortly after entering the Straight SUPER ABUNDANTE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of CALIFORNIA BOUNTY which shifted out, however, SUPER ABUNDANTE was under pressure at this time.  He said, despite being fully tested in the Straight, SUPER ABUNDANTE was disappointing in its failure to close off the race.  A veterinary inspection of SUPER ABUNDANTE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.

Near the 150 Metres, JOLLY POSH was awkwardly placed inside the heels of ROCKET LET WIN which got its head on the side and shifted in.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MASSIVE MOVE, D Whyte stated that his mount began only fairly, however, was able to obtain a forward position in the early stages without having to be ridden along.  He said making the first turn MASSIVE MOVE raced in restricted room inside ROCKET LET WIN and he had to ride his mount along to ensure that it maintained its position inside that horse.  He said MASSIVE MOVE subsequently travelled satisfactorily, however, again momentarily raced in restricted room making the turn after the 600 Metres when JOLLY POSH lay in.  He said after this MASSIVE MOVE came off the bridle and he had to ride the horse aggressively prior to the 400 Metres in an attempt to improve its position.  He added, despite being ridden out, MASSIVE MOVE did not respond and was very disappointing in the manner in which it weakened in the Straight.  He said MASSIVE MOVE appeared to be reluctant to fully stretch out after racing tight inside runners at various stages of the race.  Mr R Gibson, trainer of MASSIVE MOVE, stated that he was disappointed in MASSIVE MOVEâs performance as the horse had trialed well in the lead up to tonightâs race when ridden by D Whyte.  He said following advice from D Whyte that the horse did not appreciate racing tight on the rail inside other runners, he would give consideration to altering the horseâs gear in the future.  A veterinary inspection of MASSIVE MOVE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MASSIVE MOVE, a favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MASSIVE MOVE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said after passing the winning post on the first occasion he was left racing in a three wide position outside SPARKLING SWORD and he continued to niggle at his mount in an attempt to clear that horse.  He said, despite being urged along for a considerable distance after the 1200 Metres, CHANCELLOR did not show sufficient speed to clear SPARKLING SWORD which was travelling strongly to his inside and as a result CHANCELLOR was left racing wide and without cover throughout the race and then in the Straight gave ground.

He said in the early stages he commenced to shift HAPPY AGILITY across to race outside POPPING CANDY and for a brief moment felt that there may have been an opportunity to obtain cover behind that horse, however, ELITE SPIRIT was ridden along to establish its position to the inside of HAPPY AGILITY and as such he was not able to cross into a two wide position with cover.  He said as the race was being run at an even tempo, he did not believe it would be in the best interests of HAPPY AGILITY to ride his mount along in order to possibly cross POPPING CANDY.  He added that as a consequence HAPPY AGILITY was then left racing in a three wide position without cover.  He said after the 700 Metres and particularly rounding the Home Turn HAPPY AGILITY got its head on the side and lay out. 
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of OCTAL LUCK, J Moreira stated that his mount travelled well in a forward position in the early and middle stages and he felt as though the horse was going to finish off the race strongly.

He said the manner in which OCTAL LUCK weakened over the final 200 Metres was particularly alarming and he felt that the horse may be experiencing a problem given the manner in which it compounded.  Mr A Lee, the trainer of OCTAL LUCK, stated that he was not able to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of the horse.  He said having in mind the manner in which OCTAL LUCK weakened badly, he would consider altering that horseâs gear in its future starts including removing the blinkers.  A veterinary inspection of OCTAL LUCK immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of OCTAL LUCK was considered unacceptable.

When questioned, D Whyte (TERRIFIC MASTER) stated that at the entrance to the Straight he was following ROUGE ET BLANC and to that horseâs inside were a number of runners which he felt would likely weaken in the Home Straight.  He said therefore he committed TERRIFIC MASTER to obtain a run to the outside of ROUGE ET BLANC, also given that the rail was in the C position which can often lead to horses having difficulty obtaining runs on the inside or close to the rail.  He said as he committed TERRIFIC MASTER to the outside of ROUGE ET BLANC, that horse rolled out which presented a run between that horse and DASHING FORTUNE.  He said although he was aware that this run had been created, he was reluctant to shift TERRIFIC MASTER to the inside of ROUGE ET BLANC in case that horse then drifted back in which it did somewhat approaching the 300 Metres.  He added when ROUGE ET BLANC did shift back in, this presented a run for TERRIFIC MASTER to improve between that horse and GOLD PRECIOUS and his mount was able to obtain clear running over the final 300 Metres.

When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong, in the presence of her allocated trainer, Mr K W Lui, stated that in the early stages UNIQUE JOYFUL was able to obtain a three wide position outside DASHING SUPER.  She said near the 1100 Metres she became aware that the rider of DASHING SUPER was shifting that horse in to race on the rail and she immediately commenced to steady UNIQUE JOYFUL to obtain a trailing position behind ALL IS WELL.  She added as she was doing this, UNIQUE JOYFUL commenced to prove somewhat difficult to steady and consequently she was not able to immediately shift that horse across to obtain the available position behind ALL IS WELL.  She said as she was continuing to steady UNIQUE JOYFUL, DOUBLE POINT was ridden along from a trailing position behind UNIQUE JOYFUL to obtain the position inside her mount following ALL IS WELL and this resulted in UNIQUE JOYFUL being left racing in a three wide position without cover.  Apprentice Chiong was told that the Stewards were very mindful that her riding career in Hong Kong had only just commenced and that a necessary aspect of being an apprentice jockey is gaining experience.  She was advised however that, in the opinion of the Stewards, she could have been more assertive on this occasion when shifting UNIQUE JOYFUL across which would not have provided DOUBLE POINT the opportunity to improve inside UNIQUE JOYFUL, the consequence being that UNIQUE JOYFUL was left racing wide and without cover.

When questioned, R Fourie (SUPER LIFELINE) stated that in pre-race discussions with Mr A T Millard, the trainer of the horse, it was felt that todayâs race would be run at a good tempo given that there were a number of speed horses engaged.  He said as SUPER LIFELINE had drawn the outside barrier and with the anticipated speed in the race, it was felt that the horse, which was first up today, may have to do too much work to cross runners drawn more favourably and if it was unable to do so, then it may be left racing wide and consequently would not be able to finish off the race.  He said it was therefore decided to shift SUPER LIFELINE across behind runners in the early stages and obtain cover so as to ensure that it would finish off the race strongly.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he shifted SUPER LIFELINE across behind runners in the early stages and was able to obtain a position three wide with cover behind the eventual winner BEAUTY ONLY prior to the first turn.  He added he continued to follow BEAUTY ONLY and shifted out from behind that horse at the entrance to the Straight to make his finishing run.  He said when ridden in this manner, SUPER LIFELINE finished off the race well.
GIANT TREASURE, BEAUTY ONLY and DIVINE CALLING were sent for sampling.

When questioned, M Chadwick stated that, from barrier 2, it had been anticipated that HIGHLAND DRAGON would have sufficient speed in the early stages to be able to trail the likely leader of the race CALL ME ACHIEVER which was drawn immediately inside HIGHLAND DRAGON.  He said after HIGHLAND DRAGON began only fairly, it was beaten for speed in the early stages despite being niggled along.  He said he rode HIGHLAND DRAGON along approaching and passing the 900 Metres, however, he was unable to prevent GIDDY GIDDY from being able to cross HIGHLAND DRAGON near the 750 Metres.  He said he continued to ride HIGHLAND DRAGON along, however, the horse did not respond to his riding and as a result KIM GLORY was able to cross in front of HIGHLAND DRAGON after the 600 Metres.  He added because of the circumstances HIGHLAND DRAGON raced much further back in the field than had been intended and then after being placed under pressure in the Straight did not finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of HIGHLAND DRAGON immediately following the race confirmed the horse to be a ""roarer"" which had previously been reported.
When questioned regarding his riding of HAPPY HOMING approaching and passing the 100 Metres, Y T Cheng stated that approaching this stage of the race HAPPY HOMING was finishing off the race strongly.  He said immediately ahead of HAPPY HOMING was GIDDY GIDDY which at this time was shifting out slightly and he was undecided as to whether running would become available either inside or outside of GIDDY GIDDY.  He said although GIDDY GIDDY was initially some distance in front of HAPPY HOMING, at the stage when GIDDY GIDDY shifted in to present a run to the outside of that horse, HAPPY HOMING had improved to be racing just behind GIDDY GIDDY and he was of the belief that had he have continued riding at this time, he would have had to check away from the heels of GIDDY GIDDY.  He said for this reason he was obliged to cease riding HAPPY HOMING for a number of strides whilst he established whether running would present itself either to the inside or outside of GIDDY GIDDY.  Y T Cheng was advised that the Stewards accepted that HAPPY HOMING was closing off the race strongly and he had cause to momentarily stop riding.  He was also advised, wherever possible, to continue to ride his mounts out.

FUNNY BUDDIES brushed the running rail rounding the Home Turn.
When questioned, K C Ng stated that, from barrier 9, he had been asked to ride PEARL WIN where he was able to obtain cover.  He said he had noted that PEARL WIN had begun well in a number of its races, therefore he asked connections if the horse began well, was it available for him to lead.  He said it was explained to him that PEARL WIN races best when ridden with cover and therefore he was asked if at all possible to get a trailing position behind other runners irrespective of how the horse began tonight.  He said as he anticipated, PEARL WIN began very well, however, having in mind the explicit instructions, he commenced to shift PEARL WIN across to obtain cover.  He said as BESPOKE COLLARS was positioned immediately to his inside approaching the 1100 Metres, he was obliged to steady PEARL WIN to shift in behind that horse and this resulted in PEARL WIN racing behind midfield.  He added in the Straight PEARL WIN was inclined to lay in under pressure and therefore passing the 150 Metres he allowed PEARL WIN to shift towards the inside of LET ME DO rather than improve into a run which was to the outside of that horse and inside ANDNOWURMINE.  He said LET ME DO subsequently shifted in over the concluding stages which resulted in PEARL WIN being awkwardly placed behind that horse close to the finishing line.  K C Ng was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, there was no evidence to support his contention that PEARL WIN was laying in in the Straight.  He was also advised that he must ride his mounts in such a manner so as to ensure that they are positioned to obtain clear running and that his riding is not open to query.  After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that PEARL WIN was lame in its left front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, PEARL WIN will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of REGENCY HO HO, M Chadwick stated that based on the horse's trial in the lead up to tonight's race and the manner in which the horse had been working, he considered it to be a strong chance in the race.  He said REGENCY HO HO began well and he was able to take up a forward position without having to make use of the horse.  He said REGENCY HO HO travelled very well in the early and middle stages and he therefore expected the horse to quicken well when asked rounding the Home Turn.  He added after the 400 Metres REGENCY HO HO got its head on the side and lay out and then in the early part of the Straight was inclined to shift in when placed under pressure.  He said after this REGENCY HO HO did not stretch out and he was particularly concerned by the manner in which the horse weakened in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of REGENCY HO HO immediately following the race revealed the horse to be a ""roarer"".  The performance of REGENCY HO HO was considered unacceptable.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of OBLITERATOR, D Whyte stated that after OBLITERATOR broke through the front gates, he was able to quickly restrain the horse and return it back to the Start and, in his opinion, there was no veterinary reason why OBLITERATOR could not compete well in the race.  He said OBLITERATOR began well and he was able to take up a trailing position behind the leader FAT CHOY HONG KONG in the early stages.  He said after the 1200 Metres the tempo of the race quickened and he believed it was in the best interests of OBLITERATOR to refrain from riding the horse along at this stage to maintain its position behind FAT CHOY HONG KONG and therefore he was content to allow TWIN DELIGHT to shift in front of OBLITERATOR.  He added OBLITERATOR travelled very well in the middle stages, however, came under pressure after the 500 Metres and did not respond to his riding thereafter.

The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered if BRIGHT CONCEPT had been afforded a fair start.  Evidence was taken from Apprentice K K Chiong, Trainer W Y So and Starter, Mr T McGovern.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, it was established that as the start was effected, BRIGHT CONCEPT, which was being assisted in the stalls by a handler, got its head in the air and lost a considerable amount of ground after being very slow to leave the barrier stalls.  As the Stewards formed the view that the handler had not played any part in the manner in which BRIGHT CONCEPT had left the barrier stalls, they deemed that horse to be a runner and accordingly weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.

He said because of this he was obliged to ride THORS BOLT along, however, the horse did not quicken at any stage and finished off the race only one-paced.

For some distance near the 300 Metres, CIRCUIT LAND had difficulty obtaining clear running and then passing the 300 Metres was shifted in away from the heels of GLORIOUS SUN to improve.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he had been asked to ride SUGAR CITY in a position forward of midfield if possible from barrier 1.  He said as the start was effected SUGAR CITY began awkwardly which resulted in the horse beginning only fairly.  He said he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, CIRCUIT LAND, which was drawn immediately outside SUGAR CITY, was able to cross SUGAR CITY.  He said when another runner went forward of CIRCUIT LAND in the early stages, this resulted in SUGAR CITY racing further back in the field than had been anticipated.  He said passing the 1100 Metres SUGAR CITY became unbalanced when having to be steadied away from the heels of CIRCUIT LAND and for a short distance after this commenced to race keenly.  He added after the 600 Metres he looked to his outside to see if there was an opportunity to shift away from the rail and commence improving into the race, however, ENTITLING was racing to his outside whilst he was racing inside the heels of MARVEL HERO and, in his opinion, he would have had to steady SUGAR CITY too much to shift to the outside of MARVEL HERO.  He said therefore he continued to race to the inside of that horse and behind CIRCUIT LAND until entering the Straight.  He said at the entrance to the Straight he shifted his mount to the outside of CIRCUIT LAND in order to find clear running, however, due to the make-up of the field at that stage, there was a considerable number of horses in advance of SUGAR CITY, so he commenced to shift the horse to the outside of runners.  He said it was not until after the 100 Metres that he was able to shift SUGAR CITY to the outside of MARVEL HERO and it was only at this time that he was able to obtain clear running and fully test his mount.  Apprentice Wong was told that whilst the Stewards accepted that the manner in which SUGAR CITY began and the circumstances of the race in the early stages resulted in the horse racing further back than had been intended, he must, wherever possible, ensure that his mounts obtain clear running at the earliest available opportunity so that they are able to be properly tested.
After the race, C Schofield (KYNAM) stated that after initially obtaining a trailing position behind GLORIOUS SUN, that horse then handed up the lead to STAR OF BOND which resulted in KYNAM racing further back than had been intended.  He said KYNAM travelled satisfactorily during the middle stages, however, when placed under pressure was disappointing in the manner in which it failed to respond to his riding and weakened in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of KYNAM immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of LIGHTNING PEGASUS, N Callan stated that he had to make use of the horse to take up a forward position in the early stages.  He said however that when LIGHTNING PEGASUS raced well last week, he also had to make similar use of the horse in the early stages.  He said after the 1300 Metres he was left racing in a three wide position and without cover and therefore again had to ride LIGHTNING PEGASUS along to obtain a position one horse off the rail.  He added the tempo in the middle stages tonight was quicker than it was last week, but irrespective LIGHTNING PEGASUS came under heavy pressure after the 600 Metres and then did not finish off the race.  He said LIGHTNING PEGASUS felt ""flat"" and the horse's performance indicated to him that it may not have backed up after last Wednesday night's race.  A veterinary inspection of LIGHTNING PEGASUS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of COUP D'ETAT, J Moreira stated that having been instructed to ride the horse in a forward position, he had to make use of it in the early stages to cross runners to his inside.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion he commenced to steady his mount to obtain a trailing position behind SILVER DRAGON.  He said when he did this COUP D'ETAT immediately commenced to prove difficult to settle and over-raced for some distance.  He said it was not until approaching the 900 Metres that COUP D'ETAT commenced to travel more kindly, however, he became concerned a short distance later when he had to niggle his mount along to maintain its position behind LIGHTNING PEGASUS.  He added after placing COUP D'ETAT under pressure after the 600 Metres the horse did not quicken and then weakened in the Straight.  He said whilst the performance of COUP D'ETAT was disappointing, he attributed the horse's failure to finish off the race to the manner in which it over-raced in the middle stages.  A veterinary inspection of COUP D'ETAT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of COUP D'ETAT, a favourite for tonight's race, was considered unacceptable.

When questioned, C Schofield stated that when proceeding to the barriers SOUTHERN SPRINGS' action did not feel completely comfortable, however, he gave the horse a warm up behind the barriers and SOUTHERN SPRINGS' action improved.  He said the horse began very well and was able to take up a forward position in the early stages, however, after travelling about 100 Metres SOUTHERN SPRINGS faltered in its action and then in the run to the winning post on the first occasion was not striding out comfortably.  He said as he had concerns for the horse's welfare, he eased it out of the race.  He added immediately after the race he advised the Veterinary Officer that he was of the opinion the horse felt lame in front.

When questioned, Mr W Y So, the trainer of SIR JOHN, stated that he anticipated that tonight's race would be run at a good tempo as there were a considerable number of horses engaged in the race that generally race in forward positions in their races.  He said, from barrier 12, he was of the opinion that were SIR JOHN to be ridden to obtain a forward position, it would be left racing wide and without cover and would not be able to finish off the race.  He said therefore in pre-race discussions with B Prebble, the rider of SIR JOHN, it was felt that it would be in the best interests of the horse to take a sit and attempt to obtain cover so that it would be able to close off the race.  He added, as he anticipated, there were a number of horses ridden forward from more favourable barriers and as SIR JOHN was able to obtain cover for the majority of the race, he felt that the manner in which it was ridden provided the horse with the best opportunity to finish off the race.

He said he continued forward of that horse near the 1400 Metres in an endeavour to display that it was his intention to lead.  He said however that BEST HOPE continued to be ridden along to maintain its position to the inside of SOLAR KINGDOM.  He added as SOLAR KINGDOM had previously not finished off the race when unable to lead on the rail, he continued forward of that horse even though he was aware that the tempo of the race was fast.  He said it was not until after the 1000 Metres that BEST HOPE was steadied which allowed SOLAR KINGDOM to improve into the lead approaching the 800 Metres.  He said because of the way the race was run in the early and middle stages, SOLAR KINGDOM was then not able to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of SOLAR KINGDOM immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, K C Ng (BEST HOPE) stated that he was given explicit instructions by Mr C H Yip, the trainer of the horse, to lead if possible.  He said he was advised to ride his mount in such a manner so as to obtain the lead if possible as the horse had been successful in the lead in the most recent start.  He said however that if another runner was intent on leading and the race was being run at a particularly fast tempo, it was then acceptable for him to allow that horse to cross into the lead and take a sit behind it.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages in an endeavour to prevent SOLAR KINGDOM from crossing into the lead.  He said he had hoped that by riding his mount in this fashion that the rider of SOLAR KINGDOM would then not continue on and would maintain its position to the outside of BEST HOPE.  He said however after the 1200 Metres he was aware that the race was being run at a very fast tempo and therefore near the 1100 Metres he commenced to steady his mount to allow SOLAR KINGDOM to assume the lead.  K C Ng was advised that the Stewards would interview Mr Yip, who left the course immediately after the race, before they give consideration to this matter.  Mr Yip and Jockey Ng were advised that the Stewards would continue hearing the matter prior to the first race at the Sha Tin racemeeting to be conducted on Monday, 28 September 2015.  A veterinary inspection of BEST HOPE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding his riding out of IMPERIAL CONCORDE in the Straight, M Chadwick stated that the horse became badly unbalanced rounding the Home Turn after bumping the running rail when racing tight inside LOTUS STRIKES BACK.  He said because of this he ensured that the horse was properly balanced in the early part of the Straight before riding it out mainly hands and heels in the Straight.  He said he used the whip on a number of occasions both behind the saddle and down the shoulder and IMPERIAL CONCORDE finished off the race only fairly.  M Chadwick was advised that his riding out of IMPERIAL CONCORDE in the Home Straight had come under notice and that he must ride his mounts out with sufficient purpose and vigour so as to ensure that his riding is not open to question.

He said making the first turn he was left racing in a three wide position outside DIVINE BOY, however, SIGHT SEEING at all times had cover and travelled well in the early and middle stages.  He said when following ROMANTIC CASH, SIGHT SEEING was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse approaching the 500 Metre and after this came off the bridle.  He added, despite being placed under pressure in the Straight, SIGHT SEEING was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of SIGHT SEEING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on FIVE UP HIGH at the request of Trainer A T Millard.

Throughout the race, GIANT TURTLE and DR GOOD HABIT travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, K Teetan stated that he had been instructed to ride GOLDEN SLEEP wherever it was comfortable.  He said in a number of its previous starts in Hong Kong, the horse had proved very difficult to settle when being ridden behind runners.

The Stewards considered a protest/objection lodged by D Whyte, the rider of WINNER ST PAUL'S, which finished second, against LONDON MASTER (G Mosse), the winner of the race, alleging interference near the 900 Metres.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the official videos, the Stewards found that near the 900 Metres when racing to the outside of LONDON MASTER, WINNER ST PAUL'S lost its rightful running and was checked as a result of LONDON MASTER shifting out.  However, given that the incident occurred near the 900 Metres, the Stewards could not be satisfied that had the interference not occurred, WINNER ST PAUL'S would have beaten LONDON MASTER and accordingly the protest/objection was overruled and weighed-in declared on the numbers as displayed by the Judge.  At a subsequent inquiry, G Mosse pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that in this incident he failed to make sufficient endeavours to prevent his mount from shifting out which resulted in LONDON MASTER shifting out across the rightful running of WINNER ST PAUL'S.  G Mosse was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 26 October 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Ascot (UK) racemeeting on Saturday, 17 October 2015.

He added TIMELY ARRIVED came off the bridle before the 500 Metres and then, despite being placed under pressure, did not respond to his riding.  He said although TIMELY ARRIVED was steadied when crowded for room approaching the 200 Metres between WHISTLE BLOWER and DIEGO KOSTA, both of which shifted ground, TIMELY ARRIVED was already a beaten horse at this stage.  He said after this, despite being ridden out, TIMELY ARRIVED did not finish off the race as he expected.  A veterinary inspection of TIMELY ARRIVED immediately following the race did not show any significant findings other than the horse had twisted its right front plate, however, it was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

Then making the turn after the 900 Metres, HAPPY CHAPPY was taken wider by LIUZHOU WARRIOR which continued to race ungenerously.
DR RACE had some difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight and near the 150 Metres was shifted out away from the heels of INVINCIBLE FRESH to obtain clear running.
In the Straight, LUCKY DAY lay in under pressure and then over the concluding stages hung in, resulting in SUPER FLUKE being inconvenienced.  As a consequence, N Callan, the rider of LUCKY DAY, stopped riding his mount prior to the winning post and directed LUCKY DAY out away from SUPER FLUKE.

                CLUB LIFE began awkwardly and shifted out abruptly, resulting in BEAUTY LEAD, which began only fairly, being hampered.
ENTITLING and HAPPY CONTENDER made heavy contact at the start, causing both horses to become unbalanced.  In this incident, HAPPY CONTENDER bumped the hindquarters of BEST SHOW, causing that horse to become unbalanced and for HAPPY CONTENDER to be further hampered.
After the 1500 Metres, HAPPY CONTENDER commenced to prove very difficult to settle and got its head up when being checked away from the heels of WINNING INSTINCT.  HAPPY CONTENDER continued to race fiercely and for some distance after the 1300 Metres was severely checked away from the heels of ATHENA BABY.
Near the 1100 Metres, CLUB LIFE momentarily raced tight inside ENORMOUS HONOUR.
After the 1000 Metres, ATHENA BABY was left racing wide and without cover.
Rounding the Home Turn, TOP ACE and ATHENA BABY raced tight as TOP ACE attempted to shift out into clear running.  TOP ACE was then held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight.
Passing the 400 Metres, STRONG FOUNDATION was momentarily awkwardly placed close to the heels of ENORMOUS HONOUR.
Near the 250 Metres, HOLMES LEGEND was momentarily awkwardly placed inside the heels of WINNING INSTINCT which shifted in after being bumped by ATHENA BABY.
Passing the 200 Metres, GOOD GOOD VIEW was shifted to the outside of HOLMES LEGEND to obtain clear running.
When questioned, R Fourie (CLUB LIFE) stated that he had been asked to lead on the rail if possible.  He said after beginning very awkwardly, he rode his mount along for a considerable distance in the early stages to take up a forward position as instructed.  He said STRONG FOUNDATION was able to find the position on the rail easily inside CLUB LIFE and having in mind he had to ride CLUB LIFE along for a considerable distance, he did not believe it would be in the horse's best interests to continue to ride it along in the hope of being able to cross STRONG FOUNDATION which was travelling strongly.  He added therefore he elected to remain racing to the outside of that horse in order to allow his mount the opportunity to finish off the race.
A veterinary inspection of STRONG FOUNDATION immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
ATHENA BABY, WINNING INSTINCT and ENORMOUS HONOUR were sent for sampling.

                After being loaded, TO-KALON became very fractious and reared, resulting in its rider, M Chadwick, sustaining an injury to his right leg.  As a consequence of the indisposition of M Chadwick, the Stewards ruled that TO-KALON be withdrawn.  M Chadwick was subsequently stood down by the Club's medical officers when unfit to fulfil his remaining riding engagements.  Before being allowed to race again, TO-KALON will be required to perform satisfactorily in a series of barrier trials.
On jumping, HOLY STAR and BRILLIANT MONKEYS were crowded for room between CHOICE EXCHEQUER and CASA JUNIOR which began awkwardly and shifted out.

                LOOKS LIKE THE CAT and SAN NICASIO came into contact soon after the start.
Approaching the 900 Metres, LOOKS LIKE THE CAT got its head up when momentarily tightened for room inside SAN NICASIO which, after being taken in slightly by BLIZZARD (K Teetan), then got its head on the side and shifted in away from that horse.  K Teetan was advised that whilst the racing manners of LOOKS LIKE THE CAT exacerbated the incident, nonetheless in similar circumstances he must ensure runners to his inside are afforded comfortable racing room.  At the same stage, EROICO brushed the running rail when momentarily racing in restricted room inside WHY WHY which was taken in slightly by LOVELY DELOVELY (T H So).  SKYROCKETS, which was following, was hampered in consequence.  T H So was advised to exercise more care.
For some distance passing the 300 Metres, EROICO and CALIFORNIA BOUNTY raced tight as EROICO shifted out from behind GO BABY GO into clear running.
For the majority of the event, BLIZZARD travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, R Fourie stated that in pre-race discussions with the connections of HIGH FIVE, it was thought that if the horse were to be ridden to obtain a forward position from its outside barrier, it would most likely be caught wide and without cover carrying top weight.  He said therefore he was asked to shift HIGH FIVE across behind runners in the early stages and to find cover.  He said in the run to the first turn whilst it was available to him to improve to the inside of MY LITTLE FRIEND, he chose to remain racing on the back of that horse to provide his mount with options as to whether to improve either to the inside or to the outside and he was also concerned that if he were to improve quickly to the inside of MY LITTLE FRIEND, HIGH FIVE might be inclined to over-race.  He added as the race progressed, he was intent to allow HIGH FIVE to improve near to the inside rail and inside MY LITTLE FRIEND, however, HIGH FIVE struggled to gain any momentum in the Straight and despite being tested closed off the race only fairly.  A veterinary inspection of HIGH FIVE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that from its good barrier, WHY WHY took up a nice trailing position and travelled reasonably well throughout the early and middle stages, however, when placed under pressure in the Straight did not quicken and was very disappointing.  He added WHY WHY had trialed only fairly prior to its first up run and the horse's performance today reflected its performance in the trial.  A veterinary inspection of WHY WHY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of WHY WHY, a favourite for today's race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, WHY WHY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                In the early stages of the Straight, REDWOOD BABY and SEMPITERNAL brushed on a number of occasions due to SEMPITERNAL shifting in.
After being disappointed for clear running between SUPREME FRESH and DALWARI near the 300 Metres, PREMIUM CHAMPION (G Mosse) was shifted to the outside of DALWARI to improve.  As this occurred, REDWOOD BABY, which had made ground to the outside of the heels of PREMIUM CHAMPION, was inconvenienced when taken out onto SEMPITERNAL.  G Mosse was advised to exercise more care when shifting ground in similar circumstances.
After passing the 100 Metres, INDUSTRIALIST WAY was steadied away from the heels of AUTUMN GOLD (Z Purton) which shifted in under pressure.  Z Purton was advised to exercise more care.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that although he had intended on taking up a relatively forward position on INDUSTRIALIST WAY, the horse stumbled at the start and settled further back in the field than had been hoped.  He said approaching the 1200 Metres whilst racing with cover, INDUSTRIALIST WAY commenced to travel relatively keenly and as he felt the pace was sedate, he chose to shift out in an endeavour to improve around the field at that stage.  He said however that once he commenced a forward move on INDUSTRIALIST WAY, the horse did not quicken as he expected and after improving to be racing almost on terms with DALWARI on the first turn, he felt that he would have had to make too much use of INDUSTRIALIST WAY to continue on in advance of DALWARI and consequently INDUSTRIALIST WAY was left racing three wide and without cover in the middle stages.  He added once placed under pressure from approaching the 500 Metres, INDUSTRIALIST WAY was very one-paced and did not quicken.  He said, in his view, INDUSTRIALIST WAY was not suited by the circumstances of the race today and its performance was fair.  A veterinary inspection of INDUSTRIALIST WAY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

At the 800 Metres, FORTUNE GIGGLES was left racing wide and without cover.
Approaching the 200 Metres, MR VANILLA shifted out and made contact with CHEERFUL FRAME.
When questioned, Z Purton was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of CHEERFUL FRAME.  He said after being provided with a nice run behind the speed, CHEERFUL FRAME came under pressure at the entrance to the Straight and then did not respond to his riding thereafter.  Trainer C H Yip advised that in light of the horse's disappointing performance today, he believed CHEERFUL FRAME may not have handled the step up in distance to 1600 Metres of today's race due to its relative immaturity.  A veterinary inspection of CHEERFUL FRAME immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of CHEERFUL FRAME, a last start winner and also a favourite for today's race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CHEERFUL FRAME will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that although MISTER MARC travelled comfortably in the lead and initially responded well when placed under pressure near the 300 Metres, the horse subsequently proved disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race.  He said however it was apparent to him that MISTER MARC does not perform at its best on the Sha Tin turf course, pointing to its better established form on the Sha Tin All Weather Track and at Happy Valley.

Apprentice H N Wong was questioned regarding his riding of BORN TO WIN particularly in the middle stages.  He said as he was instructed to lead on BORN TO WIN, he rode the horse aggressively in the early stages and it took him some distance to be in a position to cross a number of runners which showed good speed to its inside.  He said after finding the lead on the rail approaching the 900 Metres, he attempted to steady BORN TO WIN in order to have it relax, however, the horse, as a consequence of being ridden along in the early stages, raced keenly and he was unable to achieve this.  He said in the middle stages as he was aware that he was setting a reasonably quick tempo, he made endeavours to have BORN TO WIN relax although he was unaware that he had opened up such a significant lead over the remainder of the field.  He added after straightening he attempted to nurse BORN TO WIN along for as long as possible as he realized that the horse had done a lot of work during the event, however, BORN TO WIN soon came under pressure and then was not able to close off the race.  He stated that, in retrospect, he had erred in failing to make a more concerted effort to have BORN TO WIN steady in the middle stages.  Apprentice Wong was reprimanded and advised that whilst the Stewards acknowledged his relative inexperience, on this occasion he had ridden an ill-judged race and that, in similar circumstances, he must be aware of the tempo that he is setting so that his mounts are able to close off and be competitive in the latter stages of the race.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that he took up a prominent position on FLORAL SPUR as instructed and the horse travelled well until the entrance to the Straight.  He said however that once placed under pressure, FLORAL SPUR did not feel properly balanced, felt awkward in its action and consequently weakened noticeably.  A veterinary inspection of FLORAL SPUR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  Before being allowed to race again, FLORAL SPUR will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned regarding the riding tactics adopted on DOMINEER, B Prebble stated that he was under no firm instructions on DOMINEER, but was asked to attempt to have the horse settle near the pace but not necessarily in the lead to assist it in seeing out the 1400 Metre journey.  He said soon after jumping he noticed a number of runners to his inside had begun well and bearing in mind that he had no explicit instructions to lead, he steadied DOMINEER and the horse relaxed well with him which allowed BEAUTY FLAME and DIVINE CALLING to cross into the lead.  He said whilst DOMINEER was initially racing in a three wide position to the outside of CONTENTMENT, he was able to shift in and find cover behind that horse at the 800 Metres.  He added DOMINEER travelled extremely well throughout the middle stages and he expected that the horse would be able to give him a good response in the Straight, however, when taken into clear running, DOMINEER immediately commenced to hang in and then did not stretch out in the Straight and weakened over the concluding stages.

When questioned, C Y Ho (JUMBO SPIRIT) stated that after the 900 Metres he was racing to the outside of BLAZING PASS which at this time was racing near the rail.  He said passing the 800 Metres he rode his mount along to improve to the outside of BLAZING PASS in an attempt to prevent that horse from shifting out, however, as he did this, BLAZING PASS shifted away from the rail to obtain a position outside SPIRIT SOARING, resulting in JUMBO SPIRIT being taken into a three wide position.  He said as he steadied JUMBO SPIRIT to obtain a trailing position behind BLAZING PASS, HEALTH WISE improved quickly to the inside of JUMBO SPIRIT and for this reason he was not able to shift in and was consequently left racing in a three wide position albeit he was eventually able to find cover behind BLAZING PASS which was subsequently taken out marginally by SPIRIT SOARING.  He added after the 700 Metres ROUGE ET BLANC improved its position around JUMBO SPIRIT, however, he was reluctant to ride his mount along to prevent that horse from improving its position as this would have resulted in JUMBO SPIRIT having to race in a four wide position without cover.  He said in the early part of the Straight he was held up for clear running behind BLAZING PASS and then shifted to the inside of that horse to follow the winner HEALTH WISE through.  He said JUMBO SPIRIT was somewhat flat-footed and near the 200 Metres, after being ridden along, was once again held up for clear running behind SPIRIT SOARING.  He said after being able to shift JUMBO SPIRIT out, his mount was again racing in a restricted position between SPIRIT SOARING and ROUGE ET BLANC which was shifting ground in advance of JUMBO SPIRIT.  He said because of this he momentarily had to stop riding JUMBO SPIRIT after the 100 Metres.  C Y Ho was advised that his explanation would be reported.  
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of DRAGON BACHELOR, B Prebble stated that his mount did not show as much early speed as it did at its last start on the All Weather Track and then was hampered near the 1600 Metres which resulted in DRAGON BACHELOR racing further back in the field than had been intended, nonetheless DRAGON BACHELOR travelled well throughout the early and middle stages.  He said he shifted DRAGON BACHELOR out rounding the Home Turn and although the horse became unbalanced when taken out shortly after entering the Straight, it continued to quicken well in the early stages of the Straight.  He added however near the 200 Metres the horse's run ended and DRAGON BACHELOR was then disappointing in the manner in which it failed to close off the race over the concluding stages.  He said the only excuse he could offer for DRAGON BACHELOR's disappointing performance today was that the horse may not have backed up from its first up start when successful as it had had quite a hard run on that occasion.  A veterinary inspection of DRAGON BACHELOR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, N Callan (THE SYLPH) stated that after the 1200 Metres he shifted in to race to the outside of the leader SPIRIT SOARING.  He said he was content to maintain this position outside that horse, however, when he steadied THE SYLPH, the horse immediately commenced to get its head up and proved difficult to settle.  He said THE SYLPH had done this on a number of occasions in its previous races and did so two starts ago when he rode the horse in the lead.  He added as the rider of SPIRIT SOARING was attempting to steady that horse, he believed it was in the best interests of THE SYLPH to improve its position into the outright lead rather than him having to fight against the horse and for it to continue to over-race.  A veterinary inspection of THE SYLPH immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding his riding out of GONNA RUN over the concluding stages, C Y Ho stated that after obtaining clear running GONNA RUN was finishing off the race strongly.  He said he rode the horse out including with the whip and last used the whip on the horse at about the 50 Metres.  He said as GONNA RUN was finishing at its top, he did not believe it was necessary to continue riding the horse with the whip and for this reason he continued to urge it forward vigorously hands and heels in the run to the line.  C Y Ho was advised that where circumstances permit he has an obligation to ride his mounts out to the best of his ability, particularly where finishes in the placings are concerned.  He was further advised that whilst his riding of GONNA RUN over the final 50 Metres did not constitute a breach of the Rules, nonetheless he must ride his mounts out in such a manner so as to leave no room for query.
When questioned, K C Leung stated that he had been asked to lead on YOUNG WATCHMAN from the outside barrier as there was not much anticipated speed in the race.  He said it was therefore hoped that the horse would be able to work its way forward and dictate the tempo of the race.  He said after having to be aggressively ridden in the early stages to cross runners to his inside, YOUNG WATCHMAN did not settle and got its head up on a number of occasions as he attempted to steady the tempo of the race.  Mr C S Shum, the trainer of YOUNG WATCHMAN, said that KYNAM and BUSINESS AS USUAL were the only horses that he anticipated would take up forward positions in the race and therefore he felt that there was an opportunity for YOUNG WATCHMAN to lead.  He said prior to being imported from Australia, YOUNG WATCHMAN had raced successfully from forward positions and he therefore felt that the opportunity presented itself today for the horse to be ridden in a similar manner.  A veterinary inspection of YOUNG WATCHMAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said after obtaining cover, SENSATION travelled reasonably well, however, when he commenced to place the horse under pressure from the 500 Metres, SENSATION did not respond to his riding at any stage and failed to quicken.  He said SENSATION was very disappointing in the manner in which it failed to respond to his riding in the Straight before finishing towards the rear of the field.  He added immediately after the race SENSATION did not appear to be comfortable in its action.  A veterinary inspection of SENSATION following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SENSATION, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SENSATION will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of RUGBY DIAMOND, B Prebble stated that at its last start when wearing a crossed nose band RUGBY DIAMOND had become agitated when proceeding to the Start and when behind the barriers.  He said because of this it was decided to remove the crossed nose band from the horse's equipment tonight and as a consequence RUGBY DIAMOND proceeded to the Start in a more settled manner.  He said from an inside barrier he was able to obtain a good position on RUGBY DIAMOND without having to ride the horse along.  He said RUGBY DIAMOND travelled well behind the speed in a race that was run at a fair tempo.  He said having in mind that RUGBY DIAMOND had travelled strongly in the middle stages, he expected the horse to finish off the race strongly.  He added however that prior to the 400 Metres RUGBY DIAMOND came under pressure and he had to ride his mount along in an attempt to improve around PLANET CHOICE.  He said, despite being vigorously ridden rounding the Home Turn and in the Straight, RUGBY DIAMOND did not respond and was then disappointing in the manner in which it weakened in the Straight.

Passing the 300 Metres, BACKBENCH BLUES was awkwardly placed close to the heels of TELEPHATIA which was giving ground.
R Fourie (ROCK THE TREE) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 250 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of RAPID TRIUMPH, causing that horse to be taken in onto TELEPHATIA and causing both RAPID TRIUMPH and TELEPHATIA to be unnecessarily crowded for room and to lose the running to which they were rightfully entitled.  BACKBENCH BLUES, which was following, was checked away from the heels of RAPID TRIUMPH in consequence.  R Fourie was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Sunday, 15 November 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 8 November 2015.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that after having to ride his mount along in the early stages to obtain a forward position, he was able to have JUMBO SPIRIT racing with cover prior to the winning post on the first occasion.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion when the race was being run at a good tempo, JUMBO SPIRIT was not able to travel comfortably.  He said after passing the winning post on the first occasion it was apparent to him that GO-GETTER, which was positioned to the inside of JUMBO SPIRIT, was being shifted out and as JUMBO SPIRIT was not travelling well enough to improve its position to prevent this from occurring, he was comfortable, given that the race was being run at a good tempo, to steady his mount rather than be taken into a three wide position by GO-GETTER.  He said when he did this, JUMBO SPIRIT, passing the 1300 Metres, appeared to lose its action and immediately came off the bridle.  He added, despite being ridden along, JUMBO SPIRIT commenced to give ground and as he was concerned for the welfare of the horse, he eased it out of the race approaching the 1100 Metres.  He said when walking the horse back to the unsaddling area after the race, JUMBO SPIRIT appeared uncomfortable in its action.  A veterinary inspection of JUMBO SPIRIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that in pre-race discussions with Mr J Size, the trainer of ENSURING, it was felt that today's race would not be run at a strong tempo and as ENSURING had drawn barrier 3, it was hoped that the horse would be able to take up a position in about midfield.  He said he was asked not to be aggressive on ENSURING in the early stages and to have the horse racing where it was comfortable.  He said after allowing ENSURING the opportunity to begin well, he was then surprised by the tempo of the race in the early and middle stages which was faster than had been anticipated, as such ENSURING got further back in the field than had been intended.  He said he was able to obtain a trailing position behind RENAISSANCE ART along the Back Straight and he was happy following this horse given that he expected that horse to perform well in the race.  He added he continued to track RENAISSANCE ART in the middle stages and followed that horse out prior to the 500 Metres when RENAISSANCE ART commenced to improve its position around ANTICIPATION.  He said as RENAISSANCE ART and ANTICIPATION were both working into the race, he elected to continue to remain racing behind RENAISSANCE ART whilst that horse was taking him into the race.  He added he shifted ENSURING out passing the 350 Metres, however, the horse did not quicken as it had at its most recent start.  He said he placed the horse under full pressure thereafter, however, ENSURING did not finish off the race as he expected and over the final 200 Metres was disappointing in that it finished off the race only one-paced.

When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that it had been anticipated that JUST PLEASANT would be able to be ridden in a more forward position, however, due to VIVA GUY being aggressively ridden to his inside, he elected in the early stages to allow that horse to improve its position rather than having to ride JUST PLEASANT along in an attempt to cross VIVA GUY.  He said because of this JUST PLEASANT raced further back in the field than had been intended.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on GLORIOUS VICTORY at the request of Trainer C S Shum.

In the early and middle stages, GOOD FOR YOU travelled wide and without cover.
After the 500 Metres, NEVER BETTER got it head on the side and hung out and as a consequence bumped the hindquarters of MOTIF which became unbalanced.
When questioned regarding his riding of GERONIMO MEADOW, T H So stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in a position just in front of midfield given that it had drawn barrier 3.  He said RAGING BULL, which had drawn barrier 2, was a horse that he expected to take up a forward position in the race and he expected possibly to obtain a trailing position behind that horse.  He said as GERONIMO MEADOW had been slow to begin in a number of its races, he rode his mount along from the barriers to ensure that the horse would begin well enough to be able to take advantage of a position behind RAGING BULL should that horse go forward as he expected it would.  He said RAGING BULL was not ridden along as aggressively as he had expected and after he rode GERONIMO MEADOW along in the early stages, he found himself positioned outside that horse in a three wide position.  He said approaching the 1300 Metres he attempted to steady GERONIMO MEADOW to shift in behind RAGING BULL, however, HAPPY AGILITY was ridden along from behind GERONIMO MEADOW and was able to improve its position to follow RAGING BULL which resulted in GERONIMO MEADOW being left racing in a three wide position without cover.  He added near the 600 Metres GERONIMO MEADOW was taken wider again by DANEWIN EXPRESS which shifted out.  He said whilst GERONIMO MEADOW had been left racing very wide after beginning from barrier 3, he felt that RAGING BULL not being ridden along in the early stages had played a significant part in GERONIMO MEADOW being left racing in this position.  Trainer C W Chang confirmed the instructions given to Jockey So and stated that he was disappointed in the fact that GERONIMO MEADOW had not been able to utilize its favourable barrier and was left racing wide.  T H So was severely reprimanded and advised that his riding of GERONIMO MEADOW in the early stages was not up to the standard expected of a senior jockey in Hong Kong.  He was further advised that he must ride his mounts in such a manner so that they do not cover unnecessary ground which therefore allows his mounts to finish off their races as best as they are able.
A veterinary inspection of RAGING BULL immediately following the race revealed that the horse was displaying an irregular heart rhythm.  Before being allowed to race again, RAGING BULL will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said OVETT showed good speed in the early stages and was able to maintain a forward position without having to be vigorously ridden along.  He said making the first turn after the 1100 Metres FRUITFUL CHAMPION was being hard ridden to his outside and he was mindful not to become engaged in a speed battle with that horse having in mind also that OVETT was carrying top weight.  He added for this reason he elected to allow FRUITFUL CHAMPION to cross into the lead and immediately shifted OVETT to the outside of that horse.  C Schofield agreed with the Stewards that in retrospect he should have made more of an effort to maintain his position inside FRUITFUL CHAMPION for whilst that horse was going forward, it was not being aggressively ridden at that stage to do so.  C Schofield was advised to ensure that, wherever possible, he rides his mounts in accordance with his instructions whilst also retaining the discretion to show judgement and initiative where circumstances require.

He said on arrival at the Start he brought this matter to the attention of the Veterinary Officer who confirmed that the horse did not have its tongue over the bit.  After the necessary consultations, JOY LUCK WIN was considered suitable to race.  D Whyte stated that after being able to obtain a good position on JOY LUCK WIN in the early and middle stages, his mount came under heavy pressure prior to the 500 Metres to maintain its position between runners.  He said despite being ridden along at this stage, JOY LUCK WIN did not respond and he had to ride it aggressively rounding the Home Turn as it was not improving its position.  He added he placed the horse under further pressure in the early part of the Straight and, when under pressure, JOY LUCK WIN shifted ground on a number of occasions and felt unbalanced in its action.  He said as he had concerns with the manner in which JOY LUCK WIN was shifting ground, he eased it down over the final 100 Metres, however, JOY LUCK WIN was well beaten at this time.  He said on return to the unsaddling area after the race, JOY LUCK WIN continued to be awkward in its action.  A veterinary inspection of JOY LUCK WIN immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horse's trachea.  The performance of JOY LUCK WIN, a favourite for tonight's race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, JOY LUCK WIN will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
JOY LUCK WIN, BOTH LUCKY and HARBOUR ALERT were sent for sampling.

From wide barriers, WAH MAY FRIEND and VERDANE were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After being ridden along for a short distance, REGENCY KING was then shifted across behind runners soon after the start to obtain cover.
K C Leung (GOODHEART SUCCESS) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the winning post on the first occasion he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of REGENCY KING, causing that horse to be taken in onto SICHUAN VIGOUR which was unnecessarily crowded for room and further, that he allowed GOODHEART SUCCESS to continue to race tight on REGENCY KING and approaching the 1300 Metres permitted his mount to shift in when not properly clear of REGENCY KING, causing that horse to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  K C Leung was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 19 November 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 8 November 2015.
The Stewards adjourned an inquiry into the reason for LUCKY DOUBLE EIGHT being severely checked away from the heels of TWIN DELIGHT passing the 1200 Metres until prior to the races on Sunday, 25 October 2015 to allow Mr Y S Tsui, the allocated trainer of Apprentice H N Wong (FAT CHOY HONG KONG) to be present.

He said LUCKY DOUBLE EIGHT then did not settle until after the 700 Metres.  He said LUCKY DOUBLE EIGHT came under pressure after the 500 Metres and in the Straight gave ground.  He added LUCKY DOUBLE EIGHT's performance was directly attributable to the fact that the horse proved very difficult to ride and would not settle in the middle stages.  A veterinary inspection of LUCKY DOUBLE EIGHT immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, LUCKY DOUBLE EIGHT will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned, C Schofield (GOOD GOOD VIEW) stated that with the rail placement today, a number of horses had been able to race well after obtaining runs close to the rail.  He said passing the 600 Metres he was positioned behind the favourite KIRAM which he expected a strong chance to win the race.  He said although it was available for him to improve slightly to the outside of that horse and inside PRINCE FALCON, he felt that it was a better option to remain closer to the inside and follow KIRAM through as that horse improved its position between runners.  C Schofield was advised that the Stewards noted his explanation, however, he must ensure that, wherever possible, he does not leave his mounts with too much to do.
When questioned regarding the improved performance of SERGEANT TITANIUM, Trainer J Size stated that the horse's preparation thus far largely mirrored that of its first up campaign when it raced well at its first start before disappointing in its subsequent race.  He said he was satisfied with SERGEANT TITANIUM's first up run this season as the horse was not beaten far.  He said subsequent to that run, SERGEANT TITANIUM did well and he expected the horse to race competitively, however, he was mindful that it had disappointed second up at the previous campaign.  He said despite being afforded every opportunity, SERGEANT TITANIUM was again disappointing second up this campaign and because of this he subsequently barrier trialed the horse on 16 October 2015.  He added SERGEANT TITANIUM performed very well in this barrier trial, given the standard of competition, and as SERGEANT TITANIUM had improved its performance further into its last campaign, he anticipated that the horse may again race well today.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of TRAVEL AMBASSADOR, D Whyte stated that whilst he did not ride the horse at its first up run in Hong Kong, it had performed well on a track rated ""Good to Yielding"".

When questioned, C Schofield stated that it had been intended for HAPPY FRIENDSHIP to be ridden in about a midfield position with cover from the horse's inside barrier.  He said when proceeding to the Start HAPPY FRIENDSHIP travelled keenly and it took him some time to pull the horse up.  He said HAPPY FRIENDSHIP sweated up prior to the start today more so than at its last start when successful.  He said without riding the horse along, it began very well and he found himself in the position of leading in the race in the early stages.  He said he attempted to steady HAPPY FRIENDSHIP in the hope that runners from wider barriers would cross his mount in the run to the winning post on the first occasion, however, HAPPY FRIENDSHIP was travelling too keenly and he believed if he had applied any further pressure to the horse, it would have over-raced which would not have been in the horse's best interests.  He added HAPPY FRIENDSHIP travelled keenly throughout the race, came under pressure prior to the 500 Metres and then weakened in the Straight.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MR VANILLA, J Moreira stated that the horse never travelled on the bridle during the race.  He said MR VANILLA was ""timid"" around other runners and because of this he was not able to take advantage of tight runs in the Straight.  He said nonetheless MR VANILLA was travelling only fairly and it was doubtful as to whether the horse was going well enough to take advantage of these runs when they became available.

B Prebble (LOTUS BREEZE) was cautioned by the Stewards regarding the appropriateness of language that he used immediately following the race.
When questioned regarding his riding out of MULTIMAX, 7th placegetter, over the concluding stages, G Mosse stated that he placed the horse under heavy pressure in the Straight.  He said approaching the 50 Metres GIANT STARS had improved quickly to his inside and that horse had then continued to improve to be racing close to the heels of LOTUS BREEZE passing the 50 Metres.  He said as the rider of GIANT STARS had his mount's head turned out in an attempt to avoid the heels of the horse in front, he felt it would be in the best interests of all concerned if he allowed GIANT STARS to shift out away from the heels of LOTUS BREEZE rather than be left racing in a dangerous position.  He added because of this he did not ride his mount out over the concluding stages.  G Mosse was advised that his explanation was accepted, however, he was informed of his obligation to ride his mounts out all the way to the end of the race where circumstances permit.

Close to the finishing line, AMAZING MOMENT shifted out abruptly.
When questioned, Mr A T Millard, the trainer of PEARL WIN, stated that  at its first run this season he had instructed K C Ng to obtain cover on the horse from barrier 9 given the makeup of the field that night and the fact that PEARL WIN had raced well when ridden with cover previously.  He added that in today's race he employed the services of a 10 lb claiming apprentice jockey which resulted in the horse being lightly weighted.  He said from a more favourable barrier and with added race fitness, he felt that there was an opportunity for PEARL WIN to race in a forward position given the makeup of the field in respect of the anticipated tempo of the race.

Before being allowed to race again, MEDALLIST will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, N Callan stated that, from barrier 9, it had been hoped that SPEEDY LONGWAH would be able to lead in the early stages before possibly handing up to CLUB LIFE.  He said he was asked to shift across with MEDIC KINGDOM and hopefully obtain a position one horse off the rail.  He said MEDIC KINGDOM was aggressively ridden in the early stages to take up a forward position, however, was not able to do so as LUCKY HAMMER was also being ridden along and for this reason MEDIC KINGDOM was left racing one horse off the rail which resulted in SPEEDY LONGWAH being obliged to race in a three wide position without cover passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He added that after CLUB LIFE crossed into the lead passing the winning post on the first occasion he was reluctant to ride his mount along in an attempt to cross MEDIC KINGDOM given that it was apparent to him that MEDALLIST, which was racing very wide, was improving its position and SPEEDY LONGWAH would be able to obtain cover behind that horse albeit in a three wide position.  He said when MEDALLIST crossed in front of SPEEDY LONGWAH after the 1100 Metres, SPEEDY LONGWAH was then able to obtain cover behind that horse.  He said as SPEEDY LONGWAH was carrying top weight, he was reluctant to improve around MEDALLIST making the turn near the 550 Metres, rather he followed MEDIC KINGDOM through and was able to track into the race nicely rounding the Home Turn.  He said in the early part of the Straight he was able to obtain clear running, however, SPEEDY LONGWAH could only finish off the race one-paced.  He said because of the circumstances of the race, he felt that the horse had raced satisfactorily.

                NOVEL START blundered on jumping.
CRIMSON HEART began awkwardly, shifted out and bumped CONFUCIUS SPIRIT which became unbalanced.
Near the 1100 Metres, DANEWIN TIGER was awkwardly placed inside the heels of NOVEL START which got its head on the side and shifted in away from HURRY HURRY UP.
Making the first turn near the 700 Metres, GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS became unbalanced when crowded for room between MIGHTY GAINS which initially shifted out slightly and CONFUCIUS SPIRIT which got its head on the side and lay in towards the heels of NOVEL START.  When GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS became unbalanced, it shifted in, resulting in MIGHTY GAINS also being crowded for room.  DANEWIN TIGER, which was following, was inconvenienced in consequence.  As there was no rider error associated with this incident, no further action was taken.
Passing the 600 Metres, DRAGON ENERGY was awkwardly placed close to the heels of MIGHTY GAINS.
Near the 550 Metres, HEARTILY WINS raced in restricted room between DANEWIN TIGER and DRAGON ENERGY.
Throughout the race, LUCKY PROFIT and CONFUCIUS SPIRIT travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS, Z Purton stated that the horse, which was having its first start on the All Weather Track, began well and he was able to take up a good position.  He said GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS travelled well in the early and middle stages and, despite being momentarily crowded for room making the turn near the 700 Metres, continued to travel well in the run up to the Home Turn.  He added given the manner in which the horse had travelled throughout the race, he expected it to finish off well, however, after being placed under pressure prior to the 400 Metres, GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS then was disappointing in its failure to close off.  A veterinary inspection of GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MIGHTY GAINS, Apprentice H N Wong stated that in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position.  He said when he observed that HURRY HURRY UP was being aggressively ridden from a wide barrier to also take up the lead, he rode his mount along more vigorously after the 900 Metres in an attempt to prevent that horse from crossing, however, MIGHTY GAINS did not show as much speed as HURRY HURRY UP and consequently near the 800 Metres he was left with no alternative but to allow that horse to cross MIGHTY GAINS.  He said as soon as HURRY HURRY UP crossed MIGHTY GAINS, his mount got its head on the side and was inclined to lay out away from the rail which contributed to the horse becoming unbalanced making the first turn.  He added that after this MIGHTY GAINS did not travel comfortably and, in his opinion, appeared to resent the kickback and lost confidence after being crossed by HURRY HURRY UP.  A veterinary inspection of MIGHTY GAINS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MIGHTY GAINS, a last start winner on the track and distance, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MIGHTY GAINS will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of BE THERE AHEAD immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained a minor cut to the right hind pastern.

                HOXO proved very difficult to load.  Having regard to HOXO's history at the barriers, the Stewards ruled that that horse will be required to undergo a series of consecutive barrier trials prior to its next race start.
After being loaded, CONSISTENT became fractious, reared and got its left front leg initially over the front gate before getting over into the adjoining stall.  CONSISTENT was removed from the barriers and examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was not suitable to race.  Acting on this advice, CONSISTENT was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  Before being allowed to race again, CONSISTENT will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
As the start was effected, CARTOON FAY FAY lifted its front feet off the ground and consequently was slow to begin.
HOXO began very awkwardly and shortly after the start, from a wide barrier, was shifted across behind runners.
Apprentice K K Chiong (JOLLY GOOD STAR) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the 1300 Metres she permitted her mount to shift in when not clear of G-ONE LEADER, causing that horse to be unnecessarily crowded for room and checked and in turn taken in onto CLASSIC JEWELLERY which was hampered.  Having in mind that Apprentice Chiong is not currently approved to ride at Happy Valley, the Stewards decided the appropriate penalty was for her licence to ride in races to be suspended for a period to commence on Thursday, 19 November 2015 and to expire on Monday, 30 November 2015 on which day she may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  In that time, there are two racemeetings scheduled to be conducted at Sha Tin Racecourse.

Over the concluding stages, CARTOON FAY FAY was unable to be ridden out and was hampered due to being taken out by CLASSIC JEWELLERY (D Whyte) which shifted out under pressure.  D Whyte was severely reprimanded and advised that in similar circumstances he would be expected to stop riding and straighten his mount.  GRAND PLUS, which was following, was inconvenienced in consequence.
A veterinary inspection of IMPERIAL CONCORDE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

G Mosse was advised that whilst NATURAL TEAM has a record of having hung out in its races previously and on this occasion he had the horse's head turned in slightly in an endeavour to prevent it from shifting out, nonetheless he was reprimanded and told in similar circumstances he would be expected to make every endeavour to prevent his mount from shifting out.
N Rawiller (RIGHT CALL) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 600 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of WINNER ST PAUL'S, causing that horse to be checked away from the heels of RIGHT CALL and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  N Rawiller was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 7 December 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).

After the race, B Prebble reported that FREE NOVEMBER did not feel comfortable in its action.  A veterinary inspection of FREE NOVEMBER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of GALLANT ROCK, K Teetan stated that his mount began fairly, however, was able to take up a prominent position in the early stages.  He said however GALLANT ROCK did not travel comfortably in the race and he attributed this to the fact that at its last start when successful the horse had raced on ""Good to Yielding"" track which was in contrast to today's firmer surface.  He added the manner in which GALLANT ROCK failed to travel indicated to him that the horse did not let down on today's surface albeit it had previously raced satisfactorily on a ""Good"" track.  A veterinary inspection of GALLANT ROCK immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, J Moreira stated that he had not been given any specific instructions on how to ride KYNAM, rather he was to assess the situation depending on how KYNAM began, particularly as the horse had drawn a wide barrier over the 1200 Metres.  He said just prior to the start being effected KYNAM turned its head to the right and this resulted in the horse missing the start.  He said he then shifted KYNAM across behind runners and immediately commenced to ride his mount along in an attempt to improve its position.  He said throughout the early and middle stages KYNAM appeared to resent racing back in the field as, despite being vigorously ridden along, the horse became detached from the field and was reluctant to improve its position.  He added KYNAM gradually commenced to improve its position after the 500 Metres to the point where it was able to tack on to the back of the field rounding the Home Turn.  He said after the 300 Metres he observed that PROMPT EXPRESS was weakening rapidly and he attempted to shift away from behind that horse, however, KYNAM initially proved reluctant to shift to the outside of PROMPT EXPRESS which resulted in KYNAM having to be severely checked away from the heels of that horse after the 250 Metres.  He said prior to this incident, having in mind the way that KYNAM had improved into the race rounding the Home turn, he felt as though the horse was going to finish off the race strongly.  A veterinary inspection of KYNAM immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that he was not able to offer any excuse for the disappointing performance of FUN TAPESTRY.  He said after enjoying a good run throughout the race, FUN TAPESTRY weakened out of the race badly in the Straight.  He said FUN TAPESTRY did not feel completely comfortable in its action during the race and, in his opinion, appeared to be restricted in its action in front.  A veterinary inspection of FUN TAPESTRY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  Before being allowed to race again, FUN TAPESTRY will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, H W Lai stated that after being able to obtain a forward position on PROMPT EXPRESS in the early stages, it was of concern how abruptly his mount gave ground rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight.  He said the manner in which PROMPT EXPRESS became unbalanced in its action and weakened concerned him at the time that it may have broken down, however, after the race the horse proceeded back to the unsaddling area sound.  A veterinary inspection of PROMPT EXPRESS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of PROMPT EXPRESS was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, PROMPT EXPRESS will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

After the race, Apprentice H N Wong reported that after being crowded for room shortly after the start, GO-GETTER did not show any early speed which resulted in the horse racing much further back in the field than had been intended.  He said GO-GETTER travelled only fairly in the run and finished off the race only one-paced.  A veterinary inspection of GO-GETTER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of IMPERIAL CHAMPION, B Prebble stated that after being able to obtain a forward position without having to be made use of, IMPERIAL CHAMPION travelled strongly in the early and middle stages.  He said he placed IMPERIAL CHAMPION under pressure at the entrance to the Straight, however, the horse did not quicken as well as he thought it would.  He said IMPERIAL CHAMPION initially commenced to finish off the race fairly, however, over the latter stages of the race was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened.  He added he had ridden the horse in track work in the lead up to tonight's race and in one piece of work on the 1800 Metre gallop it travelled very strongly.  He said he was not able to offer an opinion as to whether this may have affected the horse's performance tonight.

                As the start was effected, JAEGER BOMB lifted its front feet off the ground and consequently was slow to begin.  After this, JAEGER BOMB was shifted across behind runners.
From wide barriers, HAPPY CONTENDER, EXECUTIVE MANDATE and GOOD CHOICE were steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, HIGH WARRIOR was awkwardly placed close to the heels of YOUNG RANGER.
Near the 250 Metres, JAEGER BOMB was checked away from the heels of WILLIE INVICTUS after being disappointed for running between that horse and DALWARI.
N Callan (YOUNG RANGER) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 100 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of GO GO WIN, resulting in that horse being taken out across the rightful running of SPARKLING SWORD which as a result was checked.  N Callan was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 10 December 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 29 November 2015.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that whilst he had not been tied down to any specific instructions on how SPARKLING SWORD should be ridden, it was anticipated that the horse would be able to take up a forward position behind the speed given its favourable barrier and the fact that it had previously shown pace in its races.  He said after beginning well the pace of the race was quicker than he had anticipated and a number of horses on his inside were ridden along in the early stages to take up forward positions.  He said given the tempo of the race in the early stages, he felt that it was more advantageous for SPARKLING SWORD not to be ridden along, rather to be shifted across and obtain cover.  He said after initially shifting in behind YOUNG RANGER near the 1700 Metres, he was left racing in a position three wide outside HIGH WARRIOR approaching the winning post on the first occasion, therefore he elected to further steady SPARKLING SWORD so as to obtain a position one horse off the rail which he was able to do approaching the 1200 Metres.  He added because of the circumstances of the race in the early stages, SPARKLING SWORD travelled further back in the field than had been intended.
When questioned, Z Purton (WILLIE INVICTUS) stated that he had been asked to make the most of the horseï¿½ï¿½s inside barrier and obtain a position behind the leaders if possible.  He said it was anticipated that the race would not be run at a particularly quick tempo and therefore it would be advantageous for WILLIE INVICTUS to be able to obtain a position with cover behind the speed.  He said in the early stages DALWARI was being vigorously ridden along and he felt that had he have allowed DALWARI to cross WILLIE INVICTUS and that horse in turn may have allowed TRUMP to cross which would have resulted in WILLIE INVICTUS racing further back in the field than he had been instructed, therefore he made use of his horse to prevent DALWARI from crossing WILLIE INVICTUS with the hope that TRUMP would improve into the lead which would provide WILLIE INVICTUS with a trailing position.  He added however that TRUMP was not ridden to assume the lead and rather obtained a trailing position behind DALWARI near the 1100 Metres.  He said the early and the middle sectionals of the race were faster than what had been anticipated and because of the circumstances of the race WILLIE INVICTUS was then not able to finish off its race.  A veterinary inspection of WILLIE INVICTUS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of DALWARI, C Y Ho stated that he had to ride DALWARI along in the early stages to obtain a forward position and he was obliged to make more use of DALWARI to do so than he had hoped.  He said the tempo of the race in the early and middle stages was quite strong and DALWARI came under pressure from the 500 Metres to maintain its position.  He said despite being ridden out in the early part of the Straight, DALWARI weakened out of the race noticeably and, despite the strong early tempo of the race, in his opinion, was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of DALWARI immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of DALWARI, a winner of its two most recent starts, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, DALWARI will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that as he had been instructed to lead on CHOICE EXCHEQUER, he rode his mount along in the early stages and was able to cross runners to his inside easily and obtain the lead shortly after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said on reaching the rail, he immediately commenced to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER.  He said whilst CHOICE EXCHEQUER had established a margin over the remainder of the field, the horse initially wanted to travel keenly, however, after entering the Back Straight he was able to settle it and dictate the terms of the race in sectionals which he believed would afford the horse the best opportunity to finish off the race.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER, N Callan stated that after parading to the Start with the lead pony, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became fractious and got away from the lead pony and then proved very difficult to lead up to the Start.  He said this resulted in him having to dismount SUCCESSFUL LEADER on a number of occasions as he felt that the horse may rear up if he had remained mounted.  He said after eventually being able to be led to the Start, SUCCESSFUL LEADER travelled satisfactorily in the early stages of the race, however, came off the bridle after the 900 Metres.  He added at its most recent start the horse also came off the bridle early in the race, however, stayed on well to the line, but today the horse did not close off as it did last start and was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SUCCESSFUL LEADER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER was considered unacceptable and that horse must barrier trial satisfactorily and be subjected to an official veterinary examination before its next race start and due to being difficult to lead up to the Start will be required to arrive at the barriers in that barrier trial in a timely manner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, Z Purton stated that the race did not suit HIGH SPEED METRO as it was run at a good tempo.  He said after the 900 Metres he had to niggle at HIGH SPEED METRO in order to improve its position which was in contrast to its most recent start when the horse travelled up into the race nicely.  He said he had to continually ride HIGH SPEED METRO along prior to the Home Turn and in the Straight, however, the horse did not finish off the race as it had at its most recent starts when ridden by him.  A veterinary inspection of HIGH SPEED METRO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, a winner of its most recent start, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HIGH SPEED METRO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

A veterinary inspection of DIVINE CALLING immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of DIVINE CALLING, which finished last, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, DIVINE CALLING will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BLIZZARD, K Teetan stated that he was left racing in a three wide position in the early stages and then without cover after the 1000 Metres.  He said whilst he would have preferred to obtain cover on BLIZZARD, in his opinion, the horse was not unduly disadvantaged by having to race wide and without cover due to the slow tempo of the race.  He added during the early and middle stages BLIZZARD travelled strongly, however, came under pressure rounding the Home Turn and did not quicken as it had done when he had ridden the horse previously.  He said BLIZZARD initially stayed on one-paced in the early part of the Straight, however, over the final 200 Metres was disappointing in the manner in which it gave ground.  A veterinary inspection of BLIZZARD immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, BLIZZARD will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said in the middle stages of the race he was following WINGOLD and that horse shifted ground on a number of occasions in front of BOTH LUCKY.  He said he was initially reluctant to shift to the outside of WINGOLD making the turn after the 900 Metres to improve its position as he did not want to be taken unnecessarily wide.  He said therefore after the 700 Metres he positioned BOTH LUCKY to improve to the inside of WINGOLD, however, as he did this, WINGOLD shifted back in which resulted in BOTH LUCKY being baulked for running.  He added after the 600 Metres he shifted BOTH LUCKY to the outside of WINGOLD so as to obtain a position closer to the bulk of the field.

When questioned, N Rawiller (HURRY HURRY UP) stated that in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages to obtain a forward position.  He said after travelling a short distance he was able to obtain a position on the rail and when he observed FOTOGENIC being vigorously ridden along from a wide barrier after the 1300 Metres, he allowed that horse to go forward of HURRY HURRY UP in order to obtain a trailing position behind it.  He said after crossing into the lead, FOTOGENIC then travelled at a quicker tempo than he had expected and this allowed a margin to be established between FOTOGENIC and HURRY HURRY UP.  He added whilst it was available for him to ride his mount along at this stage to remain racing on the back of FOTOGENIC, given the tempo of the race at that time and that his horse was travelling comfortably, he was reluctant to ride HURRY HURRY UP along.  He said for this reason BRILLIANT MONKEYS was then able to shift in to obtain the position behind FOTOGENIC and in front of HURRY HURRY UP.
When questioned, Y T Cheng stated that after the 300 Metres he commenced riding ORACLE out with the whip and the horse immediately got its head on the side and commenced to lay in.  He said he continued to alternate between riding ORACLE with the whip and hands and heels in an endeavour to have the horse race truly.  He said then passing the 200 Metres when again hit with the whip, ORACLE shifted in and raced tight outside the hindquarters of GOLDWEAVER.  He added approaching the 100 Metres when persevering with the whip, ORACLE continued to lay in and for this reason at the 100 Metres he put the whip away and rode ORACLE vigorously hands and heels to the end of the race.  He said he did consider changing the whip over into the right hand after passing the 100 Metres, however, at this time ORACLE was racing tight outside GOLDWEAVER and therefore he did not believe that he would be able to use the whip effectively.
A veterinary inspection of FAST AND FURIOUS immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, FAST AND FURIOUS will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said this resulted in WHISTLE BLOWER racing back in the field.  He said consequently WHISTLE BLOWER finished off the race strongly.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on HOW SPEEDY at the request of Trainer A T Millard.  The Veterinary Surgeon reported that this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, HOW SPEEDY will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                Shortly after the start, GOOD LUCK MAN got its head on the side and shifted in despite the efforts of its rider, resulting in CONFUCIUS SPIRIT being hampered and in turn taken in onto MY LEGEND which was being ridden along in an attempt to obtain a forward position.
From a wide barrier, FORMULA GALORE was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Making the first turn after the 1100 Metres, CONSISTENT got its head on the side and shifted in towards the heels of GOOD LUCK MAN.
Making the turn near the 1000 Metres, MISSION POSSIBLE travelled keenly.
Near the 850 Metres, BO DUKE was steadied when crowded for room inside GOOD LUCK MAN which got its head on the side and shifted in away from IDYLLIC WIND which was racing tight outside GOOD LUCK MAN.  After this, IDYLLIC WIND was shifted out to relieve the tightening whilst GOOD LUCK MAN continued to race with its head on the side and lay in.
Approaching the 800 Metres, MISSION POSSIBLE raced in restricted room between SILVER DRAGON and CONSISTENT which shifted out away from the heels of IDYLLIC WIND.
Passing the 100 Metres, CONFUCIUS SPIRIT was awkwardly placed inside the heels of IDYLLIC WIND.
Over the concluding stages, FORMULA GALORE was unable to obtain clear running and consequently was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
In the Straight, HANG'S DECISION hung in and proved difficult to ride.
Throughout the race, SILVER DRAGON travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BO DUKE, K C Leung stated that the horse's run was in contrast to that of its most recent start when successful.  He said on that occasion BO DUKE was able to travel strongly in a slowly run race and consequently was able to finish off the race well.  He said the tempo of tonight's race was quicker than that of its last start, however, BO DUKE did not travel well at any stage.  He said from barrier 1 he rode his mount aggressively to obtain a forward position and then he had to continue to ride the horse along as it was reluctant to maintain its position inside GOOD LUCK MAN making the turn near the 1000 Metres.  He said BO DUKE continued to travel off the bridle and approaching the 800 Metres became unbalanced when again reluctant to maintain its positon inside GOOD LUCK MAN when momentarily tightened inside that horse.  He said BO DUKE then did not travel well and was most disappointing in its failure to run on.  He added he had ridden BO DUKE in a number of pieces of work since its last start and the horse, in his opinion, had trained on well.  Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of BO DUKE, was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of BO DUKE.  He said since its last start success BO DUKE had pleased him and based on this he expected the horse to race well tonight.  He said following BO DUKE's disappointing performance tonight, he would consider giving the horse a let-up.  A veterinary inspection of BO DUKE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of BO DUKE was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BO DUKE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MY LEGEND, D Whyte stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on MY LEGEND from an inside barrier.  He said despite being aggressively ridden  along in the early stages MY LEGEND failed to muster speed and making the first turn got its head on the side and was steadied away from the heels of CONFUCIUS SPIRIT.  He said throughout the race MY LEGEND never travelled comfortably and was reluctant to shift in towards the rail.  He added MY LEGEND briefly travelled on the bridle after the 800 Metres, however, again came under pressure after the 600 Metres.  He said MY LEGEND did not quicken at any stage and was most disappointing in the manner in which it failed to finish off the race.  Mr A S Cruz, the trainer of MY LEGEND, stated that he was disappointed with the horse's first up run this season.  He said he had asked Jockey Whyte to obtain a forward position if possible on MY LEGEND, however, it seemed that the horse does not possess sufficient early speed over the 1200 Metres.  He said therefore at this time it is his intention to consider stepping MY LEGEND up in distance in the hope that it may be able to obtain a prominent position without having to be hard ridden in the early stages of the race.  A veterinary inspection of MY LEGEND immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

ZACHARY then travelled wide and without cover throughout the race and in the Straight tailed out.  A veterinary inspection of ZACHARY immediately following the race revealed the horse to have sustained superficial overreach wounds to both heels of the right front foot.  The performance of ZACHARY was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, ZACHARY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Near the 50 Metres, BORNFREE and CHOICE EXCHEQUER raced tight.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SWEET BEAN, G Mosse stated that it had been hoped that SWEET BEAN would be able to obtain a position in about midfield from the horse's favourable draw.  He said after beginning only fairly SWEET BEAN lost ground when crowded for room between HONG KONG FAT and KEEN TACTICS, both of which shifted ground.  He said after this he rode his mount along in an endeavour to make up lost ground, however, SWEET BEAN did not show any early speed and consequently was obliged to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He added SWEET BEAN travelled satisfactorily throughout the race, however, was unable to quicken after the 500 Metres when placed under pressure  He said SWEET BEAN initially commenced to finish off the race one-paced, however, was disappointing in that over the final 100 Metres the horse, despite being ridden out, lost ground.  He stated that he had ridden SWEET BEAN in a piece of work in the lead up to tonight's race and based on that work he expected that it would perform well.  Trainer C Fownes was unable to offer any explanation for the horse's disappointing performance other than he had been disappointed that the horse was unable to utilize its favourable barrier and race in a more forward position.  He said when successful at its last start SWEET BEAN was able to obtain inside runs and on that occasion it finished off the race well.  He said he agreed with Jockey Mosse that SWEET BEAN's work leading up to the race had indicated to him that it had not shown any regression since its last start win.  A veterinary inspection of SWEET BEAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SWEET BEAN was considered unacceptable.

Approaching the 200 Metres, BRIGHT CONCEPT shifted in and inconvenienced LIGHTNING PEGASUS.
Throughout the race, GO-GETTER travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, G Mosse stated that it had been intended for GRACEFUL KINGDOM to lead from the outside barrier if possible.  He said GRACEFUL KINGDOM was last to be loaded into the barriers, however, simultaneously with the start being effected GRACEFUL KINGDOM became fractious and this resulted in the horse being slow to begin.  He said due to the amount of ground that GRACEFUL KINGDOM lost in this incident, he did not believe that it was reasonable for it to then be ridden along in an attempt to obtain a forward position, therefore he shifted GRACEFUL KINGDOM across behind runners.

He said, in his opinion, HONG KONG FAT did not handle tonight's track conditions as the horse had previously been unplaced on a similar surface.  A veterinary inspection of HONG KONG FAT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Making the turn after the 600 Metres, SGT ROCK momentarily raced in restricted room inside HAYMAKER which was taken in by STEP FASTER which shifted in marginally.
Over the concluding stages, SUPREME FLIGHT raced in restricted room inside FORMULA GALORE.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the prima facie view that an incident occurred inside the final 50 Metres which cast sufficient doubt on whether HAYMAKER should be declared the winner of the race.  B Prebble, the rider of second placed, HANG'S DECISION, viewed the video of the incident before deciding not to lodge a formal protest/objection.  As the Stewards could not be comfortably satisfied, although HANG'S DECISION was bumped by HAYMAKER which shifted out after initially shifting in and brushing STEP FASTER near the 40 Metres, having regard to the neck margin between those horses at the end of the race, they decided it was not appropriate to proceed to a formal protest/objection hearing.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on MR KOOL at the request of Trainer A S Cruz.  The Veterinary Surgeon reported that this examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horse's trachea.

                On jumping, ALL TOGETHER was badly crowded for room between RAPPER DRAGON which shifted out and LET ME DO which shifted in abruptly.  In this incident, LET ME DO became badly unbalanced after being bumped heavily on the hindquarters by ALL TOGETHER.
Approaching the 800 Metres, ACCEPTED commenced to travel keenly and got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of KINGSTON JUMBO.  After this, ACCEPTED continued to prove difficult to settle and approaching the turn after the 600 Metres became unbalanced after shifting out and bumping E-SUPER which also became unbalanced.
Making the turn near the 550 Metres, ALL TOGETHER got its head on the side and shifted out, resulting in LET ME DO being hampered when taken wider.  ALL TOGETHER continued to lay out for some distance after this.

E-SUPER lost its right front plate whilst KINGSTON JUMBO lost its left hind plate after the race.
When questioned, K Teetan stated that it had been intended for E-SUPER, which was having its first start at Happy Valley, to be ridden behind the leaders if possible.  He said in its previous races at Sha Tin, E-SUPER had begun well, however, tonight, the horse, which was fractious in the barriers, did not begin well and as it was racing at the course for the first time, he was reluctant to ride it along as he did not want E-SUPER being left racing wide given the circumstances.  He said when E-SUPER began only fairly, he allowed the horse to improve its positon to race outside ACCEPTED with cover, but further back in the field than had been intended.  He added after making contact with ACCEPTED rounding the first turn, E-SUPER was inclined to lay out and near the 450 Metres shifted out and bumped the hindquarters of MULTIMAX.  He said he placed the horse under pressure prior to the Home Turn but it was not until the time that he was able to shift the horse to the outside of ACCEPTED approaching the 200 Metres that E-SUPER lengthened stride and closed off the race strongly.
When questioned, N Rawiller (RAPPER DRAGON) stated that after becoming unbalanced shortly after the start, he was able to obtain a position with cover outside E-SUPER passing the 800 Metres.  He said he rode his mount along after the 700 Metres in an attempt to obtain an advantage over E-SUPER, however, RAPPER DRAGON did not pick up at this time and then made the first turn awkwardly after E-SUPER shifted out towards RAPPER DRAGON.  He added when this happened RAPPER DRAGON became unbalanced and it was not until after entering the Straight that he was able to get the horse properly balanced at which time he commenced to ride it along.  He said when ridden out in the Straight RAPPER DRAGON then closed off the race strongly.  He said he did feel that had it not have been for RAPPER DRAGON becoming unbalanced in the middle stages, the horse would have finished much closer than it did in the race.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of JOLLY POSH, B Prebble stated that it had been hoped that CALL ME ACHIEVER and TOP BONUS would show sufficient speed for JOLLY POSH to be able to obtain a position on the rail in the early stages as the horse has an inclination to lay in.  He said when CALL ME ACHIEVER did not show sufficient speed in the early stages, he was obliged to ride his mount forward of that horse rather than JOLLY POSH getting too far out of its ground albeit racing three wide.  He said although JOLLY POSH was inclined to get its head on to the side at various times during the race, the horse travelled tractably and was able to improve its position inside GALLANT ROCK when that horse shifted out rounding the turn.  He said however that JOLLY POSH came off the bridle at the entrance to the Straight and did not quicken at any stage.  He added the manner in which JOLLY POSH failed to run on in the Straight indicated to him that the horse did not appreciate tonight's track conditions.

Near the 150 Metres, GENTILIS was awkwardly placed inside the heels of DIEGO KOSTA which, after initially being brushed by BEAUTY PRINCE, then got its head on the side and shifted in away from that horse.
The Stewards inquired into the reason for Apprentice K K Chiong being dislodged from GENTILIS which stumbled badly passing the 50 Metres.  After taking evidence from Apprentice Chiong and C Williams, the rider of DIEGO KOSTA, the Stewards found that at this time there was a marginal shift from both DIEGO KOSTA and GENTILIS which had the consequence of GENTILIS striking the heels of DIEGO KOSTA and blundering, causing Apprentice Chiong to be dislodged.  As the Stewards were satisfied that there was no rider error associated with this incident, no further action was taken.

                As a result of A Suborics being stood down from his riding engagements earlier in the meeting, there were only two riders available to ride HYPERSONIC in this race, namely D Whyte and Apprentice H N Wong.  As Stewardsï¿½ï¿½ Instruction 17(1) preclude a 7 or 10 lb claiming apprentice jockey from replacing a senior rider, only D Whyte was available to ride HYPERSONIC.  After riding CHEVALIER STAR in Race 8, D Whyte advised the Stewards that he was not feeling well and as such was unfit to ride HYPERSONIC.  As there was not a rider available to ride HYPERSONIC, that horse was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.

After the 1200 Metres, CIRCUIT LAND was left racing wide and without cover.
For some distance approaching and passing the 1000 Metres, SANTA FE SUN proved very difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions when being checked away from the heels of LORD SINCLAIR.
Passing the 600 Metres, SANTA FE SUN and SICHUAN VIGOUR raced tight and made contact on a number of occasions as SANTA FE SUN attempted to shift out from behind LORD SINCLAIR.

Close to the finishing line, SANTA FE SUN and SICHUAN VIGOUR again raced tight.
When questioned, U Rispoli (FULL TALENT) stated that in pre-race discussions it had been felt that were FULL TALENT to be ridden in a forward positon from barrier 10 the horse may be left racing very wide and therefore it was felt that it would be best for the horse to be ridden patiently in the early stages in order for it to save ground closer to the rail.  He said the tempo of the race in the middle stages was slow but despite this, in his opinion, FULL TALENT closed off the race very well in the Straight.
When questioned regarding the performance of HIGH AND MIGHTY, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in about midfield with cover if possible from the outside barrier.  He said HIGH AND MIGHTY began well and he immediately looked to his inside with a view to obtaining a midfield position, however, as there were a number of horses racing immediately to the inside of HIGH AND MIGHTY, he did not believe it was possible for the horse to obtain this position, therefore he allowed HIGH AND MIGHTY to continue forward to obtain a position closer to the rail.  He said due to the circumstances of the race HIGH AND MIGHTY was required to race outside the leader ACCESS YEARS and then in the Straight was not able to close off the race.  He added, in his opinion, HIGH AND MIGHTY is better suited by being able to obtain cover which was not able to be achieved in this race.  A veterinary inspection of HIGH AND MIGHTY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said when this happened, HAPPY COOPERATION knuckled over badly, resulting in the horse almost falling and him becoming unbalanced.  In this incident, HAPPY COOPERATION lost its right front plate.  J Moreira added that after this HAPPY COOPERATION travelled very keenly and pulled its way into a forward positon to race outside the lead.  He said HAPPY COOPERATION was unbalanced for the majority of the race and became further unbalanced at the 500 Metres and after being placed under pressure in the early part of the Straight gave ground.  He said however that the manner in which the horse began and then over-raced in the early stages, in his opinion, accounted for the horse's disappointing performance.

M L Yeung was placed on notice that should he offend again in a similar manner in the near future, the Stewards would give consideration as to whether a monetary penalty is appropriate in the circumstances.
After the race, D Whyte was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of MAGICAL BEAUTY.  He said at the 700 Metres he was unable to prevent HARD BALL GET from shifting from a position on the rail to be racing outside SUNNY PEARL which resulted in MAGICAL BEAUTY being taken into a three wide position.  He said HARD BALL GET was able to shift out at this time despite him riding MAGICAL BEAUTY vigorously to prevent this from occurring.  He said after this he had to ride MAGICAL BEAUTY along and then again was unable to prevent HARD BALL GET from shifting out into a three wide position at the 500 Metres.  He added despite being placed under pressure, MAGICAL BEAUTY was very disappointing in the manner in which it failed to respond to his riding and weakened in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of MAGICAL BEAUTY immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horse's trachea.  Mr A S Cruz, the trainer of MAGICAL BEAUTY, stated that the horse had trained on well since its last start and he was of the opinion that the veterinary finding of a substantial amount of mucopus in the horse's trachea following the race accounted for its disappointing performance.

Making the turn near the 750 Metres, INVENTOR was steadied away from the heels of MR GINGER which, despite the efforts of its rider, got its head on the side and shifted in away from BORNTOACHIEVE which also shifted in at this point.  As there was no rider error involved in this incident, no further action was taken.
Making the turn after the 700 Metres, LONGWAH SILENT was left racing wide and without cover.
When questioned, R Fourie stated that he had been asked to ride INVENTOR positively in the early stages and obtain a positon on the rail if possible.  He said it was felt that INVENTOR would have sufficient speed to cross HIT THE BID which was drawn barrier 1, immediately inside INVENTOR.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount for some distance in the early stages to clear HIT THE BID, however, that horse began very well and was travelling strongly to his inside.  He said he did not feel it was reasonable to continue to ride INVENTOR along as he did not believe that the horse would have sufficient speed to be able to cross HIT THE BID without having to be ridden aggressively for a significant distance and as such would then not be able to finish off the race.  He said therefore he made the decision to continue racing outside HIT THE BID approaching the 800 Metres.
When questioned regarding his riding of TRILLION TREASURE in the early stages, Y T Cheng stated that he had been asked to ride the horse in the first half of the field but not to push it along in the early stages as the horse had weakened out of the race at its last start when ridden along in the early stages.  He said he was further asked to only allow the horse to use its natural speed to obtain a position in the early stages.  He said in accordance with his instructions he allowed TRILLION TREASURE to take up a forward position when the horse began well.  He said prior to the race he felt the principal speed would come from BORNTOACHIEVE which was racing to the outside of TRILLION TREASURE and his attention in the early stages of the race was directed to that horse.  He said because of this he did not immediately capitalize on the opportunity to shift TRILLION TREASURE across to race outside INVENTOR.  He added MR GINGER was then able to improve its position to be racing inside TRILLION TREASURE prior to the 900 Metres and, as a consequence, TRILLION TREASURE was left racing wide and without cover for the majority of the race.  Y T Cheng was advised that his handling of TRILLION TREASURE had come under notice and that his riding of the horse during this period of the race could have resulted in him being charged with a breach of a significant Rule of Racing.  Y T Cheng was severely reprimanded and advised that he must ensure he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they do not cover unnecessary ground and that he avails himself of the best position available in the prevailing circumstances.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on EXCELLENCE at the request of Trainer A Lee.

When questioned, U Rispoli stated that he was instructed from gate 11 to steady BACK IN BLACK in the early stages and settle towards the rear of the field and then ride for luck.  He said approaching the first turn he restrained BACK IN BLACK in an endeavour to have the horse shift over to find a position behind SAMMY'S EMPIRE, however, BACK IN BLACK was racing very keenly and had also commenced to lay out at this stage which prevented him from being able to assume the trailing position behind SAMMY'S EMPIRE.

For the majority of the race, CALIFORNIA DISEGNO travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, N Callan (DOYENI) stated that after beginning only fairly, he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion he continued to ride his mount along to cross ANTICIPATION to his inside, however, near the 1700 Metres DOYENI commenced to hang out and then near the 1600 Metres shifted out abruptly, therefore he had to apply considerable pressure to the right rein in order to shift DOYENI back over towards the rail.  He said it was not until entering the Back Straight that DOYENI commenced to race more tractably but even then was still inclined to race with its head on the side.  He added he tried to allow the horse to set a more genuine pace in front as DOYENI had responded well at its last start when racing behind a good tempo.  He said however that DOYENI was reluctant to stride along and it was not until SAVVY NATURE improved its position around DOYENI after the 1200 Metres that his mount commenced to race more genuinely.  He said when SAVVY NATURE went forward of DOYENI, he did consider allowing that horse to cross DOYENI into the lead given that DOYENI had raced well at its last start when ridden in this manner, however, he feared that SAVVY NATURE would then not continue into the lead at a genuine tempo and he did not want to get caught behind that horse were other horses to have improved around SAVVY NATURE.  He said therefore after the 1100 Metres he rode his mount along in order to consolidate its position inside SAVVY NATURE.  He added in the Straight DOYENI finished off the race only one-paced.  A veterinary inspection of DOYENI immediately following the race revealed the horse to be lame in its left front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, DOYENI will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

For the majority of the race, HIGH VOLATILITY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the performance of HERO LOOK, D Whyte stated that although the horse lifted its front feet off the ground as the start was effected and consequently lost ground, this did not prejudice the chances of HERO LOOK in the early stages as he was able to shift across towards the rail and obtain a midfield position without having to ride the horse along.  He said however that HERO LOOK did not travel on the bridle as it did at its last start and did not appear completely comfortable on the surface following some rain falling prior to the race.  He added HERO LOOK came under pressure prior to the Home Turn and in the Straight lay in and, in his opinion, was disappointing.

Shortly after the start, IMPERIAL GALLANTRY and MONSIEUR MOGOK bumped.
From the outside barrier, LEVEL PLAYER was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
When questioned regarding the performance of IMPERIAL GALLANTRY, D Whyte stated that in the early stages IMPERIAL GALLANTRY was reluctant to shift over towards the rail which resulted in MONSIEUR MOGOK being able to improve towards the inside of IMPERIAL GALLANTRY despite initially being drawn outside his mount.  He said because of the reluctance of IMPERIAL GALLANTRY to shift over towards the rail, this resulted in the horse being left racing in a three wide position without cover after the 1000 Metres.  He said IMPERIAL GALLANTRY did not travel comfortably at any stage and he had to commence riding his mount along after the 1000 Metres in order for the horse to maintain its position.  He said he had to continually push his mount thereafter and after the 600 Metres was required to ride the horse vigorously as IMPERIAL GALLANTRY was commencing to give ground.  He added although he had some concern with the manner in which IMPERIAL GALLANTRY was travelling, he persisted in riding the horse along in the hope that it would balance up and finish off its race after straightening as it had done in some of its races when ridden by him in the past.  He said after riding his mount along in the early part of the Straight, IMPERIAL GALLANTRY's action deteriorated and the horse then commenced to make an abnormal breathing noise after the 300 Metres.  He said as IMPERIAL GALLANTRY was not comfortable in its action and having regard to the horse appearing to have breathing issues, he eased it down over about the final 200 Metres.  He further stated that after the race whilst IMPERIAL GALLANTRY appeared sound in its action, the horse continued to make an abnormal breathing noise.  Trainer P O'Sullivan stated that as IMPERIAL GALLANTRY had raced greenly in its races thus far, he had added blinkers to the horse's gear in an attempt to have it race more tractably.  He said the horse had not shown any previous breathing issues in its track work or in its races, however, he would monitor the situation acting on the advice of Jockey Whyte immediately following the race.  He added, given the manner in which IMPERIAL GALLANTRY performed today, he would discuss with the owners whether to give the horse a let-up prior to its next race start.  A veterinary inspection of IMPERIAL GALLANTRY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of IMPERIAL GALLANTRY, a favourite for today's race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, IMPERIAL GALLANTRY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned, G Benoist stated that it had been intended for LOTUS BREEZE to be ridden behind the speed if possible in about 3rd or 4th position.  He said shortly after the start LOTUS BREEZE was crowded for room between UNIVERSAL UNION and METALLIC STAR which was awkwardly placed inside PURE MOMENTUM.  He said rather than ride his mount along in an endeavour to assume a forward position, he felt it was best to shift across and race behind UNIVERSAL UNION, a horse which he considered to be a good chance in the race.  He said in the early part of the Straight he ensured that LOTUS BREEZE was properly balanced before placing the horse under full pressure near the 300 Metres.  He added LOTUS BREEZE initially quickened well, however, its run ended prior to the winning post.
When questioned, C Y Ho (GONNA RUN) stated that it had been his intention to shift to the outside of MIDNIGHT RATTLER in the early part of the Straight as it is felt that the horse finishes best when able to be positioned to the outside of horses.  He said however that GONNA RUN was reluctant to shift out and therefore he was obliged to attempt to obtain clear running inside MIDNIGHT RATTLER.

When questioned, B Prebble stated that he had not been given any specific instructions on how HASTILY FEET should be ridden other than to ensure that the horse was properly balanced.  He said at its last start the horse had raced disappointingly after being unbalanced during the race and accordingly it was important to ensure that the horse was able to travel well in the race.  He said in the early stages he did not ride HASTILY FEET along rather he allowed the horse to travel where it was comfortable which was in a position behind midfield.  He said although HASTILY FEET was inclined to travel strongly at various times during the early and middle stages, he was happy with the manner in which the horse remained balanced particularly rounding the turns.  He added rounding the Home Turn he commenced to ride HASTILY FEET along to improve inside ORACLE which previously had been racing in advance of HASTILY FEET.  He said he rode HASTILY FEET along in the early part of the Straight, however, the horse commenced to lay in.  He said whilst there was a run available for HASTILY FEET to improve between FAIRY EAGLE and BULB MASTER, he was reluctant to ride HASTILY FEET up into this position passing the 400 Metres as he felt that FAIRY EAGLE would likely be directed out by its rider which would have resulted in the run closing for HASTILY FEET.  He said therefore he waited to ensure that there would be adequate room for HASTILY FEET to improve into which it did after the 300 Metres.  He said he then placed HASTILY FEET under pressure, however, the horse got its head on the side and continued to lay in until after the 200 Metres from which point it then was able to finish off the race strongly.  B Prebble was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, wherever possible, he must ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner to take advantage of runs as they become available.
A veterinary inspection of LETSGOFREE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

Passing the 300 Metres, KING BOUNTIFUL was held up when racing close to the heels of FRIENDS FOREVER which was giving ground.
In the Straight, SPEEDY WALLY raced awkwardly with its head on the side.
When questioned, H W Lai stated that from a wide barrier he had been asked to ride FRIENDS FOREVER positively in the early stages if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode FRIENDS FOREVER along for a sustained period in the early stages, however, FRIENDS FOREVER did not show sufficient speed to cross CHANCELLOR which was being hard ridden to his inside.  He said as FRIENDS FOREVER was racing wide, he elected to attempt to find cover on the horse rather than to continue to push the horse forward.  He said he shifted in in an endeavour to obtain a trailing position behind LEADING HORSE and in front of GLORY STAR, however, GLORY STAR maintained its position to his inside and this resulted in FRIENDS FOREVER being left racing in a three wide position and without cover after the 1100 Metres.  H W Lai was advised that whilst the Stewards were satisfied he had made a reasonable attempt in the early stages to obtain a forward position, after it became apparent that he would not be able to obtain cover passing the 1300 Metres, he should have continued forward on FRIENDS FOREVER rather than remained racing in a position three wide and without cover.  H W Lai was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they do not cover unnecessary ground.

Making the first turn at the 900 Metres, VICTORY HEART was crowded for room between HAMMER KING and RICHCITY FORTUNE which, when racing greenly, was directed out after initially shifting in and momentarily crowding the room of ACE KING.  CALIFORNIA JOY and EMPEROR VICTORY, which were following ACE KING, were hampered in consequence.

Over the concluding stages, VICTORY HEART was awkwardly placed inside the heels of LUCKY PROFIT which shifted in under pressure.
Throughout the race, G-ONE BO BO travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that he had been asked to ride MASTER STEED positively in the early stages if the horse began well as it had previously been ridden in a forward position, however, if the horse did not begin well, he should ride it quietly as it was at its last start when successful.  He said MASTER STEED began well today and therefore he decided to capitalize on this by riding the horse along in the early stages to take up a forward position with the expected leader of the race and favourite WHO ELSE BUT YOU.  He said when being ridden along in the early stages MASTER STEED did not feel fluent in its action, however, he was able to obtain a position outside WHO ELSE BUT YOU near the 900 Metres.  He added when he steadied MASTER STEED, the horse travelled strongly and he felt that it was travelling well enough at this time to finish off the race.  He said he placed MASTER STEED under pressure rounding the Home Turn, however, the horse did not respond to his riding after the 300 Metres and commenced to give ground.  He said MASTER STEED was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened over the concluding stages.  He further stated that after having ridden MASTER STEED at its last two starts, it may be that the horse would be able to finish off its races better if ridden more patiently than it was today and accordingly he will recommend this to connections for their consideration.  A veterinary inspection of MASTER STEED immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MASTER STEED, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SMART DELIGHT, Z Purton stated that the horse, which was resuming in today's race, had been able to take up a forward position in its recent barrier trials with ease, however, today had to be ridden along to clear TEAM FORTUNE to its inside.  He said after obtaining the lead inside I'M THE WON FOR U, SMART DELIGHT travelled satisfactorily, however, came under heavy pressure shortly after the 400 Metres.  He said SMART DELIGHT did not respond to his riding and shortened stride noticeably and passing the 300 Metres did not feel comfortable in its action.  He added, due to the manner in which SMART DELIGHT was weakening, he felt that something may have been amiss with the horse and therefore he eased it down over the final 200 Metres.  He said whilst SMART DELIGHT did not feel lame, nonetheless the horse would not stretch out when placed under pressure in the early part of the Straight.

He added passing the 200 Metres BUNDLE OF JOY became unbalanced in its action and therefore he had to stop riding the horse for a number of strides before being able to rebalance BUNDLE OF JOY, however, it was well beaten at this time.  He said after this BUNDLE OF JOY did not close off and raced disappointingly.  A veterinary inspection of BUNDLE OF JOY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, Mr J Moore, the trainer of EXCITING DREAM, stated that he did not believe it would be in the best interests of the horse to be ridden back in the field as it would not be able to give away too much start to the horses that he expected to take a strong hand in the race.  He said accordingly, he instructed K C Leung, the rider of EXCITING DREAM, to be positive on the horse in the early stages and take up a forward position if possible.

When questioned, R Fourie stated that he had been instructed to ride JET SET DRAGON in about 3rd or 4th position if possible.  He said after beginning with the field, a number of horses drawn inside JET SET DRAGON were ridden to obtain forward positions and he believed that he would have had to ride JET SET DRAGON along in the early stages to cross runners to his inside, in particular NOVEL START.  He said as he felt that the tempo in the early stages was quite good, he elected to steady JET SET DRAGON in the run to the first turn and obtain cover rather than make too much use of the horse to take up a forward position as instructed.

Throughout the race, SMART UNION travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of FUNNY BUDDIES, G Benoist stated that he was able to obtain a good position behind the leader BUSINESS AS USUAL in the early stages.  He said he became concerned with the manner in which FUNNY BUDDIES was travelling after the 900 Metres as the horse was reluctant to maintain its positon directly behind BUSINESS AS USUAL.  He said he had to ride FUNNY BUDDIES along after the 700 Metres in order to maintain its position and then after the 500 Metres had to place the horse under considerable pressure.  He added, despite being vigorously ridden out, FUNNY BUDDIES did not respond to his riding and commenced to give ground rounding the Home Turn.  He said he was not able to offer any explanation for the horse's disappointing performance.  Mr D J Hall, the trainer of FUNNY BUDDIES, stated that he was not able to offer any explanation for the horse's disappointing performance as he expected it to perform particularly well given its inside barrier.

A veterinary inspection of FUNNY BUDDIES immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of GALAXY PRANCER, D Whyte stated that he rode his mount along in the early stages in an attempt to take up a good position.  He said however GALAXY PRANCER was reluctant to stretch out and because of this raced further back in the field than had been hoped.  He said passing the 1000 Meters he was racing in a position one horse off the rail following the eventual winner HAPPY MOMENTS and whilst there was an opportunity for him to shift GALAXY PRANCER to the rail to improve its position inside HAPPY MOMENTS, he noted that the rider of HAPPY MOMENTS had a number of looks to his inside and he felt that rider was going to direct HAPPY MOMENTS towards the rail which would have provided GALAXY PRANCER an opportunity to improve its position.  He said GALAXY PRANCER maintained its position one horse off the rail, however, he was not concerned by this as he wanted to ensure that GALAXY PRANCER was given clear running in the Straight so as to finish off the race as best as it could.  He added GALAXY PRANCER did not commence to travel strongly until near the 700 Metres despite the race being run at an average tempo.  He said he shifted GALAXY PRANCER out rounding the Home Turn and placed the horse under pressure, however, he was unable to prevent PLAIN BLUE BANNER from shifted out to his inside in the early part of the Straight and then, despite being ridden out, GALAXY PRANCER was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  He further stated that when placed under pressure in the Straight, GALAXY PRANCER did not feel completely comfortable in its action.  A veterinary inspection of GALAXY PRANCER immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, GALAXY PRANCER will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After the race, B Prebble stated that the tempo of the race in the early stages did not suit SIR JOHN given that, in his opinion, the horse has difficulty in seeing out the 1650 Metres.

When questioned, D Whyte stated that he had been instructed to lead on HAPPY SPIRIT as the horse was successful at its last start when ridden in the lead.  He said it was explained to him that HAPPY SPIRIT is immature, having only its third race start and that the horse is one-paced and therefore leading the race would provide it with the best opportunity to perform well.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode HAPPY SPIRIT for some distance in the early stages in an attempt to lead, however, it did not show sufficient speed to prevent BRIGHT CONCEPT from crossing his mount approaching the winning post on the first occasion.  He added, passing the winning post on the first occasion, ROBUST MOMENTUM was ridden along in an attempt to cross HAPPY SPIRIT and therefore he had to again ride his mount along for some distance to prevent ROBUST MOMENTUM from crossing his mount so as to comply with his instructions.  He said near the 1000 Metres he was able to consolidate his position outside PEARL WARM WARM, however, because of the quick tempo of the race in the early and middle stages, he was not able to lead.  He said approaching the 500 Metres PEARL WARM WARM was able to shift away from the rail, resulting in HAPPY SPIRIT being taken into a three wide position after which HAPPY SPIRIT lost its action and became unbalanced for some distance.  He further stated that HAPPY SPIRIT then commenced to give ground abruptly and when giving ground was not comfortable in its action.  He said whilst HAPPY SPIRIT was very disappointing, he felt that the circumstances of the race were in contrast to those of its most recent start when successful in that the horse on that occasion was able to lead on the rail in a slowly run race.  A veterinary inspection of HAPPY SPIRIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HAPPY SPIRIT, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HAPPY SPIRIT will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that he had been instructed to lead on BRIGHT CONCEPT and to allow the horse to run along in the early and middle stages.  He said BRIGHT CONCEPT had previously performed well over a similar distance at Sha Tin on 5 July 2015 when allowed to run along in front and not be restrained and it was for this reason that he was asked to ride the horse similarly tonight.  He said after obtaining the lead passing the winning post on the first occasion, he did not ride the horse along, however, as instructed, he did not restrain BRIGHT CONCEPT which resulted in the race being run at a strong tempo.  He added, unlike in the referred race when the horse was allowed to stride along in front, BRIGHT CONCEPT did not finish off the race tonight and gave ground in the Straight.  Mr W Y So, the trainer of BRIGHT CONCEPT, confirmed that it had been agreed for the horse to be allowed to stride along tonight due to it previously racing well when ridden in this manner.  He said nonetheless he did not expect the horse to set as quick a tempo as it did, particularly after the 1200 Metres.  Z Purton was advised that whilst BRIGHT CONCEPT had been allowed to stride along at a good tempo in the previous race that he referred to, nonetheless the sectionals on that occasion were not as fast as they were in this race.  He was further advised to ensure that, wherever possible, he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to finish off their race.  A veterinary inspection of BRIGHT CONCEPT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said he commenced to ride MIZZEN GREY along to improve into a run which was available in advance of MIZZEN GREY between COOL PAL and HEAR THE ROAR.  He said when he was improving to the outside of the heels of COOL PAL, that horse commenced to drift out under pressure which resulted in MIZZEN GREY being awkwardly placed outside the heels of COOL PAL until passing the 100 Metres.  He said he was wary at this time of COOL PAL shifting out further and he was hesitant to ride MIZZEN GREY aggressively at this stage until he was able to ascertain whether COOL PAL was going to continue to shift out.  He said when he judged that COOL PAL was no longer shifting out and after HEAR THE ROAR was able to improve its position to the outside of MIZZEN GREY, he then placed the horse under pressure again, however, this was over the concluding stages of the race.  C Schofield was advised that whilst the Stewards agreed that MIZZEN GREY had been badly held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight, they were of the opinion that he could have ridden MIZZEN GREY with more purpose after obtaining a position to the outside of COOL PAL.  He was further advised that whilst COOL PAL did shift out marginally under pressure, nonetheless the Stewards were of the opinion that he could have made a greater effort to place the horse under pressure on this occasion.  He was advised to ensure that he tests his mounts with sufficient vigour so as not to come under notice.
A veterinary inspection of GOLDEN PARTNERS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of SURREAL immediately following the race confirmed the horse to be a ""roarer"" which had previously been reported.

Near the 150 Metres, ONE OF A KIND was bumped by HAPPY AND HEALTHY which shifted out after initially being brushed by CASH COURIER.
When questioned, C Y Ho stated that it had been expected MISTER MARC would be able to use its natural speed to obtain the lead.  He said MISTER MARC has been able to lead its races over distances shorter than the 1800 Metres of today's race and therefore it was anticipated that the horse would have little difficulty in being able to lead without having to be ridden along.  He said as it was anticipated that the horse would have natural speed to lead, he was asked not to ride it along in the early stages to ensure that it would not over-race having regard to the distance of today's race.  He said MISTER MARC began well and he allowed the horse to improve its position in the early stages of its own accord.  He said however that a number of horses, which were drawn more favourably than MISTER MARC, were ridden aggressively to obtain forward positions and therefore he would have been obliged to ride MISTER MARC along in an endeavour to improve its position to cross MIDNITE PROMISE immediately to his inside and then other runners drawn closer to the rail.  He added as the tempo of the race in the early stages was good, he elected to attempt to obtain a position with cover passing the 1600 Metres.  He said when MIDNIGHT PROMISE stayed wide after the 1100 Metres, he allowed MISTER MARC to improve its position in order to cross ROUGE ET BLANC and obtain the lead.  He said when he shifted in to race outside ROUGE ET BLANC approaching the 1000 Metres, that horse was allowed to maintain its position to his inside, therefore he remained racing to the outside of ROUGE ET BLANC.  He said passing the 900 Metres he was able to obtain cover when MIDNITE PROMISE, which had continued to race wide, shifted in to race outside ROUGE ET BLANC.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated it was explained to him that MIDNIGHT PROMISE has been missing the start in a number of its races and accordingly if it did so today, he should ride the horse in about a midfield position or towards midfield.  He said however that Mr W Y So, the trainer of MIDNIGHT PROMISE, advised him that if the horse, which had not started since November 2015, began well, he could obtain a forward position but with cover if possible.  He said MIDNIGHT PROMISE began well and at no stage in the early stages did he have to ride his mount along.  He said he allowed the horse to obtain a forward position whilst at all times looking for a position with cover.  He said due to the circumstances of the race he was not able to obtain cover and accordingly after the 1000 Metres he allowed his mount to improve its position to be racing outside ROUGE ET BLANC.  He confirmed that it was not anticipated that MIDNIGHT PROMISE would lead in today's race.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of ROUGE ET BLANC, Z Purton explained it was anticipated that MISTER MARC would lead which would allow ROUGE ET BLANC to race to that horse's outside.  He said he rode his mount along in the early stages and was able to take up a forward position near the 1600 Metres.  He said the tempo of the race in the middle stages was somewhat faster than he had hoped, nonetheless ROUGE ET BLANC appeared to travel comfortably and he expected the horse to respond to his riding in the Straight given that it had raced over the 2200 Metres at its most recent start.  He said however that ROUGE ET BLANC came under pressure in the early part of the Straight and, despite being fully tested, was disappointing in the manner in which it failed to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of ROUGE ET BLANC immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of HEALTH WISE immediately following the race revealed that the horse was displaying an irregular heart rhythm and had bled from both nostrils.  Before being allowed to race again, HEALTH WISE will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                FABULOUS ONE shifted out at the start and bumped SIMPLY INVINCIBLE.
Approaching the 200 Metres, ALMABABY, which was giving ground, was momentarily steadied away from the heels of ALL GREAT FRIENDS which shifted in.
Passing the 150 Metres, PERPETUAL TREASURE was hampered when having to be shifted out away from the heels of IMPERIAL CHAMPION which, when giving ground, shifted out.
Throughout the race, ALMABABY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, S de Sousa (IMPERIAL CHAMPION) stated that near the 1000 Metres he was able to shift across to race outside FABULOUS ONE and had intended to remain racing in this position.  He said accordingly, he restrained IMPERIAL CHAMPION, however, passing the 900 Metres the horse would not relax and was travelling far too keenly.  He said for this reason he allowed the horse to stride into the lead at the 700 Metres rather than continuing to fight against the horse.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that he was able to obtain the lead on FABULOUS ONE in the early stages as instructed and after shifting in to race on the rail after the 1000 Metres commenced to steady the tempo.  He said at this stage IMPERIAL CHAMPION, from a wider barrier. shifted in to race outside FABULOUS ONE and FABULOUS ONE was initially reluctant to settle.  He said making the turn near the 900 Metres he observed that IMPERIAL CHAMPION was racing keenly and proving difficult to restrain and as he did not want to become engaged in a speed battle with that horse, he elected to steady FABULOUS ONE and allow IMPERIAL CHAMPION to cross.  He said the tempo of the race, particularly after the 800 Metres, was strong and he did not believe it would be in the best interests of the horse to continue to race in the lead inside IMPERIAL CHAMPION.  He added in its previous races when successful FABULOUS ONE had been able to travel on the bridle until about the 300 Metres, however, today because of the manner in which IMPERIAL CHAMPION was racing, FABULOUS ONE came off the bridle earlier than had been hoped.  He said he held the horse together for as long as possible, however, he was forced to commence to ride the horse along after the 400 Metres.  He said FABULOUS ONE did not quicken when asked in the early part of the Straight and then gave ground noticeably over the remainder of the race.  Mr W Y So, the trainer of FABULOUS ONE, stated whilst he was disappointed with the manner in which FABULOUS ONE weakened in the Straight, he was of the opinion that the circumstances of the race, namely IMPERIAL CHAMPION racing to the outside of FABULOUS ONE, had been a significant factor in the manner in which the horse performed.  He said nonetheless, he would recommend to the owners that FABULOUS ONE be given a freshen up.  A veterinary inspection of FABULOUS ONE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of FABULOUS ONE was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FABULOUS ONE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of TOO FAST, Z Purton stated that as TOO FAST had raced disappointingly this season and as it was anticipated that the race would be run at a good tempo, it was decided for the horse to be ridden quietly in the hope that it would finish off the race.  He said near the 700 Metres TOO FAST became unbalanced when bumped on a number of occasions by GLACIER BLUE which shifted out, but he said this had no effect on the horseï¿½ï¿½s performance.

GLORIOUS AVENUE lost its left front plate approaching the 1100 Metres.
Making the first turn, GLORIOUS AVENUE (C Y Ho) got its head up and shifted out across the heels of BRIGHT STAR, resulting in LET ME DO being hampered and losing ground.  After this, LET ME DO was left racing wide and without cover.  C Y Ho stated that after this incident GLORIOUS AVENUE did not travel well and then in the Straight did not respond to his riding and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of GLORIOUS AVENUE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, due to the fractious nature of the horse, a full endoscopic examination was unable to be conducted.  The performance of GLORIOUS AVENUE, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, GLORIOUS AVENUE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Approaching the 800 Metres, BRIGHT STAR got its head on the side and shifted out towards the heels of GRACE HEART.

                GOLDEN SLEEP was hampered on jumping by CLUB LIFE which began very awkwardly and shifted in abruptly.
Shortly after the start, ROYAL PARTNER shifted in and bumped CLUB LIFE.
From the outside barrier, LEOWL was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After the 1300 Metres, SUPEROI was momentarily crowded for room inside TONYBOY which was taken in by RED MARVEL which was racing tight inside ROYAL PARTNER.
After the 800 Metres, RED MARVEL was awkwardly placed close to the heels of CLUB LIFE.
After the 300 Metres, RED MARVEL raced tight between HEROIC GURU and CLUB LIFE which shifted out.
Passing the 200 Metres, CLUB LIFE was steadied away from the heels of RED MARVEL (V Cheminaud) which shifted to the inside of SUPEROI to obtain clear running.  V Cheminaud was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he is sufficiently clear when shifting ground in similar circumstances.
At the 100 Metres, GOLDEN SLEEP was shifted out away from the heels of BEAUTY KINGDOM after being awkwardly placed behind that horse.
For the majority of the race, ROYAL PARTNER travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
When questioned, S de Sousa (GOLDEN SLEEP) stated that approaching the 700 Metres he was racing to the outside of SUPEROI and became unbalanced after that horse shifted out and bumped GOLDEN SLEEP.  He said because GOLDEN SLEEP was unbalanced at this time, he was reluctant to follow SUPEROI forward, rather he preferred to ensure that GOLDEN SLEEP was balanced so that it would be able to take the turn after the 600 Metres.  He said whilst it was available to him to follow SUPEROI forward at this time, he felt that GOLDEN SLEEP's best interests were served by having the horse balanced and following HEROIC GURU, the winner of the race, through until straightening.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he afforded SUPEROI the opportunity to be in a forward position from barrier 1, however, after being urged along in the early stages, SUPEROI was not able to obtain as forward a position as had been hoped.  He said making the turn for some distance after the 1300 Metres SUPEROI raced tight inside TONYBOY and therefore he allowed that horse to cross SUPEROI as his mount was not travelling well enough to improve and consolidate its position inside TONYBOY.  He said after allowing TONYBOY to cross SUPEROI after the 1100 Metres, SUPEROI proved difficult to settle and was awkwardly placed close to the heels of TONYBOY.  He said when the tempo of the race was only average after the 900 Metres, SUPEROI commenced to prove very difficult to settle and was checked away from the heels of TONYBOY and HEROIC GURU.  He added he consequently shifted SUPEROI out away from the heels of HEROIC GURU approaching the 700 Metres and allowed SUPEROI to improve its position.  He said whilst it was available to him to remain racing behind ROYAL PARTNER in a three wide position after the 600 Metres, having in mind the manner in which SUPEROI had raced in the middle stages, he believed it was best not to break SUPEROI's momentum by restraining the horse to race behind ROYAL PARTNER and he made the decision to continue to improve around ROYAL PARTNER.  He said in hindsight he believed it may have been better to remain racing behind ROYAL PARTNER until entering the Straight, however, at the time he was very mindful of the manner in which the horse had over-raced when behind runners and that it had been able to improve its position around ROYAL PARTNER without having to be ridden along to do so.  N Rawiller was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that the racing manners of SUPEROI had played a part in the manner in which he had ridden SUPEROI after the 700 Metres, nonetheless, wherever possible, he should ensure that he does not give his mounts too much to do so that they can finish off their races as best as they are able under the circumstances.
When questioned, G Benoist stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on CLUB LIFE if possible.  He said after beginning very awkwardly he then rode his mount along, however, CLUB LIFE got its head up and was awkward in its action.  He said as he was not able to cross UNBEATABLE GUTS which was ridden along to the inside of CLUB LIFE, he elected to sit outside that horse, however, approaching the winning post on the first occasion he noticed that both CHARITY KINGDOM and BEAUTY KINGDOM from wide barriers were being ridden along to press for the lead.  He said rather than continue to ride CLUB LIFE along, he elected to take a trailing position on CLUB LIFE in the hope that it would be able to finish off the race.  He added, as it was explained to him that the horse at its last start had weakened in the Straight after running too freely in the lead, he felt that it was best not to push the horse along to prevent CHARITY KINGDOM and BEAUTY KINGDOM from crossing CLUB LIFE.  He said however that when racing behind horses tonight, CLUB LIFE did not settle as well as he had hoped.
C Schofield (SPARKLING SWORD) stated that from an inside barrier he rode his mount along to take up a forward position as is usual with the horse, however, he was unable to prevent UNBEATABLE GUTS from crossing SPARKLING SWORD passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said when UNBEATABLE GUTS subsequently handed up the lead to CHARITY KINGDOM, this resulted in SPARKLING SWORD racing further back than had been intended.  He said SPARKLING SWORD travelled only fairly in the race and after being placed under pressure in the Straight was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SPARKLING SWORD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of ROYAL PARTNER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Over the concluding stages, MAJOR CONNECTION was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GLORY HORSIE.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of RUMINARE, G Mosse stated that after being loaded into the barriers his mount became fractious.  He said from barrier 14 it had been intended for the horse to lead if possible, however, if not, to take a trailing position behind the leader.  He said he had to make considerable use of RUMINARE in the early stages to obtain a forward position, but was able to trail the leader of the race TOP BONUS after the 900 Metres.  He said his mount was then inclined to lay in and came under heavy pressure near the 600 Metres to maintain its position.  He said, despite being ridden out, RUMINARE was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race.  He added the only possible excuse he could offer for the horseï¿½ï¿½s disappointing performance today was that it may not have handled the ï¿½ï¿½Good to Yieldingï¿½ï¿½ track conditions as it appeared to pull up sound after the race.

Throughout the race, RICHCITY FORTUNE travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, G Mosse (PLANET CHOICE) stated that because the horse had drawn the outside barrier he had been asked to ride it in about a midfield position with cover if possible.  He said it was felt that too much use of the horse would have to be made in the early stages were it to be ridden for speed as it had been in its previous races.  He said it was anticipated that there would be sufficient speed drawn close to the rail in a race to be run at a good tempo.  He said in accordance with his instructions, although PLANET CHOICE began well, he steadied his mount shortly after the start in order to obtain a trailing position behind RICHCITY FORTUNE which was also being steadied to obtain cover.  He said it took him some time to be able to steady PLANET CHOICE to obtain a position behind RICHCITY FORTUNE and before he was able to achieve this PLANET CHOICE was hampered and taken wider making the first turn near the 900 Metres.  He added because the race was then not run at a good tempo, PLANET CHOICE proved difficult to settle in the middle stages and was left racing wide.  Trainer K L Man stated he anticipated that C P POWER and HAMMER KING would obtain forward positions and that RICHCITY FORTUNE may also be ridden for speed in the early stages and as those horses were drawn more favourably than PLANET CHOICE, he believed it would be in the horse's best interests, from the outside barrier, to be ridden with more patience today in the hope that it would obtain a position with cover and then be able to finish off the race.  He said although PLANET CHOICE had finished second over the 1200 Metres previously, he believed that were the horse to be ridden for speed today, it would then not be able to close off the race.  He said however the race was not run at a tempo that he anticipated.  G Mosse was advised that whilst the Stewards were mindful that he had been instructed to attempt to obtain cover, they were of the opinion, having regard to the manner in which the horse began, it would have been reasonable for him to take advantage of that and ride the horse in a forward position as had been the case of late.  Mr Man was advised that his explanation would be noted, however, he must ensure that, wherever possible, horses are ridden in a consistent manner and that the rider of horses trained by him are given some latitude in regards to the manner in which they are able to ride to the circumstances of the race.  A veterinary inspection of PLANET CHOICE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, PLANET CHOICE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said along the Back Straight HAPPILABABY raced with its head on the side and then making the first turn became badly unbalanced when bumped heavily on the hindquarters by BAMBOO DANCE which resulted in the horse again losing ground.  He added after this HAPPILABABY did not travel well and continue to want to lay in.  He said whilst this was the first occasion that he had ridden the horse in a race, after having ridden it in a barrier trial in the lead up to today's race, HAPPILABABY appeared to him to race well when able to travel on the bridle which was not the case today because of the manner in which the horse began and then being bumped near the 900 Metres.

Making the first turn after the 600 Metres, FLYING FORCE got its head up when being checked away from the heels of KINGSTON JUMBO.  ALL TOGETHER, which was following FLYING FORCE, shifted out when being checked away from the heels of that horse, resulting in REWARDING FLYER being checked when taken out across the heels of TRILLION TREASURE.
Close to the finishing line, KINGSTON JUMBO shifted out abruptly, resulting in FLYING FORCE being checked when crowded for room inside COURAGEOUS BROTHER.   As this was the second consecutive occasion that KINGSTON JUMBO had shifted out abruptly close to the winning post and also having regard to the fact that the previous occasion also involved a night racemeeting at Happy Valley, the Stewards ruled that KINGSTON JUMBO shall not be permitted to race in any night racemeetings.  Trainer W Y So was also advised that they would continue to monitor the horse's racing manners and should KINGSTON JUMBO shift ground in a similar manner in the future, consideration would be given as to its suitability to continue racing.
When questioned regarding his riding of FLYING FORCE in the Straight, C Schofield stated that he had been following KINGSTON JUMBO throughout the race and shortly after entering the Straight shifted his mount to the inside of that horse and commenced to ride FLYING FORCE along.  He said KINGSTON JUMBO commenced to shift in under pressure after the 300 Metres and he therefore shifted FLYING FORCE to the outside of that horse passing the 200 Metres.  He added he commenced to ride FLYING FORCE along to take advantage of running between KINGSTON JUMBO and COURAGEOUS BROTHER, however, FLYING FORCE raced in restricted room between those horses which both shifted ground.  He said when COURAGEOUS BROTHER was shifted out passing the 100 Metres, he commenced to ride FLYING FORCE along vigorously, however, close to the finishing line was severely checked as a result of being bumped by KINGSTON JUMBO.  C Schofield was advised that whilst the Stewards were of the opinion that he was fully entitled to the belief that KINGSTON JUMBO would shift in further approaching the 200 Metres and therefore it was reasonable for him to shift FLYING FORCE out at this time, in their opinion, he should have ridden FLYING FORCE more vigorously than he did to take advantage of tight running between KINGSTON JUMBO and COURAGEOUS BROTHER prior to that horse shifting ground over the concluding stages.  C Schofield was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so as to improve into runs as they become available.
After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that COURAGEOUS BROTHER had sustained a small wound over the back of its right hock.

Y T Cheng was advised that whilst, in the opinion of the Stewards, the tempo of the race had slackened markedly at this point, they were satisfied that this was not as a result of any actions on his behalf to restrain STARTLING POWER and that STARTLING POWER had lost ground at this time of its own accord.  Nonetheless Y T Cheng was severely reprimanded for not being more alert to STARTLING POWER losing momentum at this time which would have afforded him the opportunity to take appropriate measures to ensure that runners behind STARTLING POWER had adequate time to react.

When questioned regarding his riding of AMAZING FEELING approaching and passing the 300 Metres, J Moreira stated that in the early part of the Straight he had been held up for clear running behind LITTLE FANTASY.  He said after ascertaining that there was not a run available to the inside due to DIAMOND MYSTERIOUS racing directly inside AMAZING FEELING, he then continued to be held up for running behind LITTLE FANTASY.  He said passing the 350 Metres he commenced to shift AMAZING FEELING out from behind LITTLE FANTASY to take advantage of a run which had been created by NUMERO UNO shifting to the outside of NONE OTHER.  He said as he was shifting out from behind LITTLE FANTASY, he received a precautionary call from his outside and became aware that RACING HERO was improving its position between AMAZING FEELING and NUMERO UNO.  He added as he was of the opinion that to continue to shift out may cause interference to RACING HERO, he directed his mount back in behind LITTLE FANTASY as he made a quick decision that he may not have been entitled to shift out.  He said after this AMAZING FEELING was badly held up for clear running behind LITTLE FANTASY and NOBLE ALPHA which improved to the outside of that horse and consequently he was not able to test AMAZING FEELING as clear running did not eventuate until after the 100 Metres.

When questioned regarding his riding of HIGH VOLATILITY particularly near the 200 Metres, Y T Cheng stated that it was expected HIGH VOLATILITY would be out-paced in the early stages as it was stepping back in distance to the 1000 Metres of today's race.  He said he was asked to ride HIGH VOLATILITY along in the early stages to ensure that the horse did not get too far out of its ground.  He said he was also instructed that if possible he should make his run towards the outside.  He said in the early stages, despite being vigorously ridden along, HIGH VOLATILITY did not show any early speed and he had to ride the horse along aggressively for about the first 200 metres of the race in an endeavour to have it as close to the leaders as possible.  He said after the 800 Metres he niggled his mount along in an endeavour to maintain its position and after the 700 Metres again continued to ride HIGH VOLATILITY along.  He added approaching the 400 Metres he was following COUNTRY MELODY which was racing behind the leader IMPERIAL CHAMPION.  He said passing the 350 Metres COUNTRY MELODY shifted to the outside of IMPERIAL CHAMPION which lay in and at this time he used the whip on HIGH VOLATILITY in an endeavour to follow COUNTRY MELODY.  He said when hit with the whip, HIGH VOLATILITY shifted in, placing him away from the outside rail.  He said as he was a number of lengths behind the horses in front, he balanced HIGH VOLATILITY up in order to shift to the outside rail to continue to follow COUNTRY MELODY through as there were a number of horses that were racing to the inside of IMPERIAL CHAMPION, namely ACCEPTED and RIGHTEOUS.  He added when he commenced to shift HIGH VOLATILITY out, IMPERIAL CHAMPION was some way ahead of HIGH VOLATILITY, however, when he was in a position to shift HIGH VOLATILITY out across the heels of IMPERIAL CHAMPION, that horse gave ground quicker than he anticipated and consequently he was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse near the 200 Metres.  He said after the 200 Metres he was able to shift HIGH VOLATILITY to the outside of IMPERIAL CHAMPION and after which he immediately commenced to place the horse under pressure and HIGH VOLATILITY then finished off the race strongly.  Mr K W Lui, the trainer of HIGH VOLATILITY, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Cheng.  After considering all the circumstances of this matter, Y T Cheng was severely reprimanded and advised that his riding of HIGH VOLATILITY approaching and passing the 200 Metres had come under notice.  He was further placed on notice that he must ride his mounts in such a manner so as to leave no room for query.

The Stewards considered a protest/objection lodged by J Moreira, the rider of the 3rd placed, PENIAPHOBIA, against AEROVELOCITY (Z Purton) being declared the winner alleging interference over the final 200 Metres.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, the Stewards found that PENIAPHOBIA was initially crowded for room inside AEROVELOCITY passing the 200 Metres when that horse got its head on the side and hung in under pressure.  The Stewards further found that AEROVELOCITY was then shifted out to relieve the tightening to PENIAPHOBIA, however, again hung in under pressure passing the 150 Metres, causing PENIAPHOBIA to be checked.  Having regard to the manner in which both horses were travelling in the lead up to this incident and the margin between them at the end of the race, the Stewards could not be comfortably satisfied that had the interference not occurred PENIAPHOBIA would have finished in front of AEROVELOCITY and accordingly the protest/objection was overruled and weighed-in declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.  At a subsequent inquiry, Z Purton was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the 150 Metres he failed to take sufficient measures to prevent AEROVELOCITY from shifting in which resulted in the horse shifting into the rightful running of PENIAPHOBIA, causing that horse to be crowded for room, to become unbalanced and to lose ground.  Z Purton was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 18 February 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Saturday, 6 February 2016.
G Mosse (FREDERICK ENGELS) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that at the 75 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of NOT LISTENIN'TOME, causing that horse to be crowded for room inside CHARLES THE GREAT, to be checked and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  G Mosse was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 3 March 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 21 February 2016.  In addition, G Mosse was fined $30,000 in lieu of a suspension for a period incorporating 1 further raceday.  In assessing the deferral period for the commencement of this suspension, the Stewards took into consideration the number of riders who may not be available for the Sha Tin racemeeting on Wednesday, 10 February 2016.

When questioned, S de Sousa stated that he had been asked to ride BEAUTY KINGDOM in a forward position if possible.  He said BEAUTY KINGDOM began only fairly, shifted out at the start and bumped CHINA DELIGHT which resulted in his horse becoming unbalanced.  He said he rode BEAUTY KINGDOM along for a short distance, however, he formed the opinion that he was going to have to make too much use of the horse to continue forward and cross runners to his inside, therefore he elected, shortly after the start, to shift his mount across and obtain cover.  He said he felt this was the best option for the horse under the circumstances as had he have persevered in riding BEAUTY KINGDOM forward, the horse would have been left racing very wide.  He added near the 1200 Metres he was able to obtain a position one horse off the rail in about midfield.  He said when the tempo of the race quickened after the 500 Metres, BEAUTY KINGDOM was left flat-footed and then finished off the race only one-paced.

Approaching and passing the 200 Metres, FIVE UP HIGH and DASHING KING raced tight.
Throughout the race, ULTIMATE GLORY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, K C Leung stated that he had been given two sets of instructions on how GRAND HARBOUR should be ridden from a wide barrier.  He said if GRAND HARBOUR were to begin well, he was asked to obtain a forward position on the horse but not to ride it too aggressively to do so.  He said however that if GRAND HARBOUR was not able to show sufficient speed to cross runners to his inside without having to be made use of, then he should obtain cover on the horse.  He said GRAND HARBOUR began well and he looked to take up a forward position, however, ULTIMATE GLORY, which had drawn immediately inside GRAND HARBOUR, was also ridden along in the early stages and he felt he would have to make too much use of GRAND HARBOUR to cross runners to his inside.  He added he was also mindful of the fact that if he was not able to cross runners to his inside, he may be left racing wide.  He said for this reason he steadied GRAND HARBOUR approaching the winning post on the first occasion and obtained a trailing position behind ULTIMATE GLORY.
When questioned, H W Lai stated that he had been instructed to obtain a position behind the leaders if possible on LITTLE DRAGON.  He said in the early stages he rode his mount along in order to obtain a forward position.  He said when it was apparent to him that FIVE UP HIGH was being ridden to obtain a forward position, he elected, shortly after the start, to obtain a trailing position behind that horse as the tempo of the race in the early stages was good.  He said after shifting LITTLE DRAGON behind FIVE UP HIGH, he rode his mount aggressively to maintain that position, however, due to the tempo of the race at the relevant time, he was not able to follow FIVE UP HIGH and passing the winning post on the first occasion was left racing in a position three wide outside GLACIER BLUE.  He further stated he elected to steady LITTLE DRAGON and obtain a trailing position behind that horse one horse off the rail.  He added whilst LITTLE DRAGON raced much further back in the field than had been intended, the tempo of the race in the early stages had been the reason for this occurring.  A veterinary inspection of LITTLE DRAGON immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PACKING PEGASUS, which was having its first race start, Z Purton stated that the horse showed good speed in the early stages as it had done in its barrier trials leading up to todayï¿½ï¿½s race.  He said the horse travelled strongly in the early and middle stages, however, came off the bridle passing the 400 Metres.  He said in its barrier trials PACKING PEGASUS had responded well when asked for an effort, however, today, despite being ridden out, PACKING PEGASUS did not respond and was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened out of the race.  He added over the concluding stages PACKING PEGASUS did not feel comfortable in its action, however, the horse was well beaten at this time.

Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, HIGH SPEED METRO was momentarily crowded for room between SUCCESSFUL LEADER and SPICY SIAM which got its head on the side and shifted in away from KING BOUNTIFUL which was shifting in.  When SPICY SIAM was shifted out to relieve the tightening to HIGH SPEED METRO, GOLD TARTINI, which was racing to the outside of that horse, clipped the heels of SPICY SIAM and blundered badly, resulting in its rider, B Prebble, becoming badly unbalanced.  SMART GUY, which was following, was checked away from the heels of GOLD TARTINI in consequence.  Whilst this incident was one of some significance, the Stewards were of the opinion that it occurred as a result of a number of circumstances, none of which were related to rider error and accordingly no further action was taken.

When questioned regarding his riding of LEADING HORSE in the early part of the Straight, K C Leung stated that rounding the Home Turn he shifted LEADING HORSE to the outside of PEARL FURU as he did not expect that that horse would take him into the race.  He said he positioned LEADING HORSE to take advantage of a run between PEARL FURU and THE RAINBOW should it eventuate in the early part of the Straight.  He added at this time LEADING HORSE was racing just to the outside of the heels of PEARL FURU and as he felt that a run may become available between those horses, he did not want to break LEADING HORSE's momentum by having to steady it to shift to the inside of PEARL FURU which at this time was racing away from the rail.  He said LEADING HORSE was then held up for clear running as the run did not immediately open, however, near the 300 Metres THE RAINBOW shifted out which resulted in the run nearly becoming available inside that horse and to the outside of PEARL FURU.  He added he rode LEADING HORSE along to improve into what was tight running between those horses, however, prior to being able to improve into the run, PEARL FURU shifted out marginally which resulted in the run no longer being available.  He said he then shifted LEADING HORSE to the inside of PEARL FURU passing the 300 Metres and then obtained clear running.  K C Leung's explanation was accepted.

He said at the 400 Metres he rode TRIUMPHANT LIGHT to improve into tight running between FINE ROCK and MAGICAL BEAUTY, however, TRIUMPHANT LIGHT did not quicken and because of this he was not able to take advantage of the run prior to MAGICAL BEAUTY shifting in under pressure.  He added approaching the 250 Metres he attempted to shift to the outside of MAGICAL BEAUTY, however, a run did not eventuate between MAGICAL BEAUTY and G-ONE LEADER and this resulted in TRIUMPHANT LIGHT and G-ONE LEADER bumping.  He said after being briefly awkwardly placed close to the heels of MAGICAL BEAUTY passing the 250 Metres, he then directed TRIUMPHANT LIGHT to the inside of that horse to obtain clear running.

From wide barriers, JOLLY SPRING and FORMULA GALORE were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Passing the 1000 Metres, VICTORY HEART was steadied when crowded for room between SUPER SPRINTER which initially shifted out and HAMMER KING (J Moreira) which shifted in.  J Moreira was advised to exercise more care in similar circumstances.  LOVE CHUNGHWA, which was following, was shifted out away from the heels of VICTORY HEART in consequence.
Approaching and making the first turn, LOVE CHUNGHWA proved very difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions.
After the 900 Metres, HAMMER KING was left racing wide and without cover.
At the entrance to the Straight, HAMMER KING was steadied away from the heels of BRIGHT CONCEPT which was taken out by SUPREME FLIGHT which in turn was taken out by GOOD MAN (Z Purton).  Z Purton was advised to exercise more care in similar circumstances.

Close to the finishing line, TOM'S CHARM was awkwardly placed behind SUPERIOR BOY and JOLLY SPRING and as a consequence was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the prima facie view that an incident occurred passing the 150 Metres which cast doubt on whether HAMMER KING (J Moreira) should be declared the winner.  After viewing the videos, a protest/objection on behalf of the connections of GOOD MAN was not proceeded with.  The Stewards found that after coming from behind GOOD MAN, HAMMER KING commenced to hang in near the 200 Metres under pressure and approaching the 100 Metres shifted in and bumped GOOD MAN which became unbalanced.  It was further found that a short distance later HAMMER KING, which continued to lay in, again made contact with GOOD MAN which shifted out slightly after becoming unbalanced due to the initial contact.  Having regard to the manner in which HAMMER KING had made up ground to be gaining an advantage over GOOD MAN and the manner in which both horses finished off the race, the Stewards believed that there were insufficient grounds to proceed with a formal protest/objection hearing and accordingly weighed-in was declared on the numbers semaphored by the Judge.  Whilst it had no bearing on the Stewards' decision not to proceed with the matter, Z Purton did not lodge a formal protest/objection on behalf of the connections of GOOD MAN.  J Moreira was severely reprimanded and advised that whilst HAMMER KING was hanging in, he would be expected to stop riding and straighten his mounts to prevent causing interference to other runners in similar circumstances.
A veterinary inspection of LOVE CHUNGHWA immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

MCQUEEN lost its left hind plate near the 1400 Metres.
Near the 1300 Metres, CONSORT (C Soumillon) commenced to prove very difficult to manage and was severely checked after shifting out across the heels of WERTHER (H Bowman) which shifted in.  When CONSORT was checked, WHITE MAGIC was hampered in consequence.  After this, CONSORT continued to prove very difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of WERTHER.  After viewing the videos and taking into consideration C Soumillonï¿½ï¿½s evidence regarding the racing manners of CONSORT at this time, the Stewards accepted that CONSORTï¿½ï¿½s racing manners had contributed significantly to this incident, nonetheless H Bowman was severely reprimanded and advised to ensure that he leaves comfortable racing room for runners to his inside.
Passing the 1300 Metres, THE MONARCH got its head up when being steadied to avoid the heels of SUN JEWELLERY which shifted in marginally.
Rounding the Home Turn, CALIFORNIA DISEGNO was checked when crowded for room between WERTHER which was racing tight to its outside whilst maintaining its line and SUN JEWELLERY (R Moore) which attempted to shift to the outside of BLIZZARD which shifted out.  SUN JEWELLERY was then shifted back in to relieve the tightening to CALIFORNIA DISEGNO.  R Moore was advised that whilst BLIZZARD had rolled out in advance of his mount rounding the Home Turn, by attempting to place SUN JEWELLERY to the outside of BLIZZARD, this resulted in CALIFORNIA DISEGNO being crowded for room.  R Moore was advised to exercise more care in similar circumstances.  In this incident, WERTHER became unbalanced at the entrance to the Straight after being bumped by CALIFORNIA DISEGNO.
For the majority of the race, WHITE MAGIC travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Mr T P Yung, the trainer of FRIENDS OF KA YING, said the horse was stepping up significantly in distance to the 1800 Metres today.  He said from a wide barrier he felt that were the horse to be ridden to obtain a forward position, it was most likely that it would be required to race without cover and he believed that over the 1800 Metres FRIENDS OF KA YINGï¿½ï¿½s chances would be best aided by being able to race with cover.  He said for this reason although he did not believe the race would be run at a good tempo, he felt that it was best for FRIENDS OF KA YING to be shifted across behind runners to ensure that it was able to race with cover.

When questioned, G Mosse stated that throughout the race he had followed the eventual winner LINE SEEKER on POWER OF ONE which was having its first race start in Hong Kong.  He said when LINE SEEKER was shifted to the outside of runners at the entrance to the Straight, he shifted POWER OF ONE out with that horse to obtain clear running rather than attempting to pursue a run between LUCKY EVER and TOP BONUS.  He said he felt that it was important for POWER OF ONE's finishing effort not to be halted and he believed that there was more likelihood of POWER OF ONE obtaining clear running to the outside of LUCKY EVER rather than pursuing runs inside that horse.

He said he was further instructed to shift the horse to the outside of runners in the Straight to make its finishing run.  He said GOOD FOR YOU began awkwardly and then was inconvenienced when DUTCH WINDMILL shifted out.

He said in the early and middle stages he was able to obtain a trailing position behind MASSIVE POWER, however, was further back in the field than had been intended.  He said when MASSIVE POWER improved its position approaching the 500 Metres, he rode his mount along to follow that horse, however, GOOD FOR YOU did not quicken and MASSIVE POWER was able to establish a margin over GOOD FOR YOU at this time.  He added in accordance with his instructions, he shifted his mount out in the Straight and was able to place it under pressure, however, GOOD FOR YOU got its head on the side and hung in.  He said he continued to ride his mount along until passing the 150 Metres at which time it was awkwardly placed close to the heels of FASHION MAESTRO.  He said near the 100 Metres he was able to shift GOOD FOR YOU away from the heels of FASHION MAESTRO to obtain clear running over the concluding stages.  Trainer Y S Tsui confirmed that with the addition of blinkers, he anticipated that the horse would be able to show early speed and obtain a position behind the leaders.

Y T Cheng was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must, wherever possible, ensure that his mounts are able to obtain clear running so that they are able to be properly tested.

After the race, G Lerena stated that his mount was making an abnormal breathing noise.  A veterinary inspection of RACING HERO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that it had been intended for SICHUAN DAR to be ridden handier to the lead, however, he was unable to prevent RACING HERO from crossing SICHUAN DAR.  He said when RACING HERO subsequently handed up to ISHVARA and then FANTASTIC KAKA, this resulted in SICHUAN DAR racing further back in the field than had been intended.  He added SICHUAN DAR did not quicken with the field after the 600 Metres and came under pressure rounding the Home Turn.  He said in the Straight there was room for SICHUAN DAR to improve between BERLINI and JOYFUL TRINITY, however, SICHUAN DAR was reluctant to improve into this run and this resulted in SICHUAN DAR racing tight outside BERLINI.  He said over the concluding stages SICHUAN DAR then finished off the race fairly.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of FANTASTIC KAKA, R Moore stated that he rode his mount along in the early stages in an attempt to obtain a forward position.  He said when it was apparent that the rider of ISHVARA was intent on leading the race, he allowed that horse to cross FANTASTIC KAKA and hoped to sit to its outside.  He said then after the 1100 Metres JUN HUO was allowed to improve its position and rather than ride his mount along to prevent that horse from shifting in, he elected to allow JUN HUO to cross FANTASTIC KAKA which resulted in his mount being able to take a trailing position behind ISHVARA.  He added when the tempo of the race quickened after the 600 Metres, FANTASTIC KAKA was left flat-footed and, despite being placed under pressure, did not quicken and over the remainder of the race was disappointing in the manner in which it failed to close off.

For the majority of the race, GOLDEN OSMANTHUS travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, K C Leung (VIVA GUY) stated that he anticipated the pace of the race might slacken along the Back Straight, therefore he shifted his mount out from behind the second last horse and commenced to improve its position.  He said after initially making good ground around a number of runners, the tempo of the race seemed to increase after the 800 Metres and because of this he had to ride VIVA GUY along approaching the 700 Metres to maintain its position.  He said he felt that had the tempo of the race slackened in the Back Straight, VIVA GUY would be left at a disadvantage, however, the tempo of the race did not slacken as he expected that it would.
When questioned, Trainer A Lee stated that he had asked Jockey M L Yeung to ride SUM WIN DRAGON positively from a wide barrier.  He said he felt that apart from FRESH AND FRESH, there were no other horses engaged in the race which would normally take up front running positions and that there may be a position available either outside FRESH AND FRESH or perhaps even behind that horse if it opened up a margin over the remainder of the field.  He said with tonight's race being run on the C+3 course, he felt that it would be more beneficial for SUM WIN DRAGON to obtain a forward position given the make-up of the field rather than getting back in the field and having to make ground.  He added SUM WIN DRAGON raced well tonight given its beaten margin.

Also after the 1100 Metres, APACHE SPIRIT got its head up on a number of occasions when proving difficult to settle.
Near the 550 Metres, YOURTHEWONFORME, which was proving difficult to settle, and WINNING MASCOT were crowded for room inside GRIFFINDOR when YOURTHEWONFORME improved of its own accord between WINNING MASCOT and GO-GETTER where there was insufficient room.  As the Stewards were satisfied that this incident was due to the tempo of the race and the racing manners of YOURTHEWONFORME, no further action was taken.
GO-GETTER lost its left hind plate near the 500 Metres.
Passing the 400 Metres, YOURTHEWONFORME was checked away from the heels of GO-GETTER.
Near the 250 Metres, KITAYA was momentarily crowded for room inside PEARL FURU which was taken in by HANG'S DECISION (B Prebble) which shifted ground when hanging in and being ridden along.  Whilst the Stewards were of the view that B Prebble should have done more than he did on this occasion to correct HANG'S DECISION which was hanging in, nonetheless having regard to the degree of interference caused to KITAYA, it was decided in the circumstances that a severe reprimand was warranted.  B Prebble was reminded of his obligation to make every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground wherever possible.
Passing the 250 Metres, GO-GETTER was shifted out away from the heels of KITAYA and PEARL FURU to obtain clear running.
Passing the 200 Metres, KITAYA, which got its head on the side and shifted out, was awkwardly placed inside the heels of HANG'S DECISION which shifted in marginally.  KITAYA was then awkwardly placed close to the heels of HANG'S DECISION for the remainder of the race and consequently was not able to be properly tested.
Close to the finishing line, GO-GETTER was checked when crowded for room between HANG'S DECISION which was shifted out by its rider to alleviate pressure to runners on its inside and BALTIC WARRIOR (G Lerena) which shifted in.  G Lerena was reprimanded and advised that whilst the movement from HANG'S DECISION had a significant bearing on this incident, nonetheless in similar circumstances he would be expected to make every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that he attempted to find cover in the early stages on HANG'S DECISION as the horse began from barrier 9 and was racing at the distance for the first time.  He said in the early stages he was left in a position four wide outside GRIFFINDOR and was unable to obtain cover on HANG'S DECISION behind that horse.  He said he then allowed HANG'S DECISION to improve its position forward of GRIFFINDOR in the hope that he may be able to obtain a position with cover, however, after the 1300 Metres HANG'S DECISION was left racing three wide and without cover.  He added after the 1000 Metres he considered allowing HANG'S DECISION to improve its position into the lead due to the very slow tempo of the race at this time.  He said however that he was aware THANKSGIVING, which was leading, assumed that position in most of its races and PEARL FURU, which was racing to that horse's outside, was ridden by an apprentice jockey and he felt that had he have allowed HANG'S DECISION to improve its position, the riders of those horses would not have allowed HANG'S DECISION to cross and would have increased the tempo accordingly.  He said he therefore reluctantly decided to remain racing in a three wide position having in mind that HANG'S DECISION was attempting the distance for the first time, was balanced and was racing comfortably.  He said he formed the view that to improve its position at this time would not have had a material advantage given that he anticipated THANKSGIVING and PEARL FURU would maintain their positions in the lead. 
KITAYA, THANKSGIVING and APACHE SPIRIT were sent for sampling.

When questioned, M L Yeung stated that as DASHING SUPER was racing over 1800 Metres, he was asked to obtain a forward position, but if possible not to ride his mount too aggressively to do so.  He said it was anticipated that NORTHERN FALLS would lead which would afford DASHING SUPER the opportunity to race outside that horse.  He said he was able to fulfil his instructions passing the 1400 Metres as DASHING SUPER was able to obtain a position outside of NORTHERN FALLS which was leading the race.  He added after this the pace of the race slackened appreciably and he gave consideration to allowing DASHING SUPER to improve its position into the lead, however, he formed the opinion that NORTHERN FALLS would not surrender the lead and the effect of him allowing DASHING SUPER to improve around NORTHERN FALLS would increase the tempo of the race.  He said therefore he elected to remain racing to the outside of NORTHERN FALLS and then after the 700 Metres permitted HAPPY CONTENDER to cross NORTHERN FALLS as this then increased the tempo of the race.  He said when the tempo of the race was slow, DASHING SUPER travelled on the bridle, however, at no stage over-raced and therefore he was content to remain racing outside NORTHERN FALLS.

G Mosse (WAH MAY FRIEND) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that approaching the 300 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of SUPER FLUKE, causing that horse to be checked and in turn taken in onto HARD BALL GET which was racing tight to the outside of CLASSIC EMPEROR.  This resulted in HARD BALL GET being severely checked when crowded for room between CLASSIC EMPEROR and SUPER FLUKE, blundering and falling.  When HARD BALL GET fell, LUCKY SCEPTER, which was following, was hampered in consequence.  G Mosse was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 28 April 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (7 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 3 April 2016.

This incident was also compounded by MY LITTLE FRIEND shifting in away from the heels of GO BABY GO when continuing to be awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse.  Z Purton was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he had initiated the incident by shifting out, however, during the latter stages of the incident, NOT LISTENIN'TOME was left with no option but to shift out due to SUPER JOCKEY taking up the room made vacant by NOT LISTENIN'TOME and then shifting out further marginally.  Both Z Purton and J Moreira were advised to exercise more care in similar circumstances.
After the 600 Metres, RAD got its head on the side, hung out under pressure and proved difficult to ride.  RAD continued to hang out and for some distance approaching the 300 Metres raced tight inside AMBER SKY.  Then over the concluding stages, RAD was steadied when it continued to hang out and also when racing tight between AMBER SKY and SUPER JOCKEY, both of which shifted a minimal amount of ground.

When questioned, Mr T P Yung, the trainer of BRIGHT STAR, stated that at its most recent starts from wide barriers, he had asked for the horse to be ridden positively in the early stages in order to attempt to obtain a position with cover if possible.  He said particularly at its most recent start he anticipated that the race would be run at a slow tempo and he asked the rider of the horse to go forward as he felt that it would have to be too far back in the early stages were it to be steadied to obtain cover.  He said from barrier 4 today, he had asked M L Yeung, the rider of BRIGHT STAR, to obtain a position in about midfield, however, if the race was run at a slower tempo, it would be acceptable to him for the horse to be in a slightly more forward position.  He added ideally, depending on the circumstances of future races, he hoped that BRIGHT STAR would be ridden in a position in about midfield or slightly in front of midfield with cover.
A veterinary inspection of HOT HOT PEPPER immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained a minor wound above the right hind pastern.
A veterinary inspection of EXTREMELY FUN immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse's trachea.

When questioned, J Moreira stated that he had been instructed to ride MY DARLING in a forward position and it was hoped that the horse, from barrier 10, would be able to obtain a position in the first three.  He said just prior to the start being effected MY DARLING commenced to become unsettled and as the start was effected began only fairly.  He said he looked to his inside and ascertained that a number of horses drawn more favourably than MY DARLING were being ridden along, therefore he made the decision not to persevere with riding MY DARLING forward, instead he elected to shift the horse across behind runners.  He said after having begun only fairly, he was mindful that MY DARLING was having only its second race start in Hong Kong and its first around a bend and he believed that to have ridden the horse aggressively given the manner in which it began may not have been in its best interests.  He said after shifting across behind runners, MY DARLING was hampered on a number of occasions in the middle stages by FLYING FORCE which shifted out.  He said this resulted in MY DARLING becoming unbalanced and being taken wider.  He added after shifting MY DARLING out in the Straight, the horse finished off the race only fairly.  He said whilst MY DARLING did not take up a forward position during the race as intended, this was solely due to the manner in which the horse began.  Trainer J Size confirmed that he had instructed Jockey Moreira to obtain a forward position as the horse had shown speed in a number of its barrier trials.  He said after considering the manner in which MY DARLING began, he was comfortable with Jockey Moreira's decision to shift the horse across behind runners rather than persevere to obtain a forward position.  Having regard to all the circumstances, J Moreira's explanation was accepted.  A veterinary inspection of MY DARLING immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, MY DARLING will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said the horse, which had only had four starts in this jurisdiction, had disappointed him in the manner in which it failed to close off its races.  He said as ALMABABY was stepping back up in distance to 1200 Metres today, he had instructed Y T Cheng to ride the horse positively in the early stages from its wide barrier as with the rail in the C position he believed that its best opportunity to finish off the race would be for it to obtain the lead if possible.  He added whilst he anticipated that the horse may improve in today's race if it was able to dictate the terms of the race in the lead, he did not expect that it would run as well as it did.

When questioned, Z Purton stated that, as is usual, he shifted ELECTRONIC PHOENIX behind runners from the wide barrier to obtain a position with cover as ELECTRONIC PHOENIX had proved difficult to manage in some of its races.  He said approaching and making the turn at the 900 Metres he was following METALLIC STAR, however, that horse, despite being vigorously ridden along, lost its position and this resulted in ELECTRONIC PHOENIX becoming somewhat detached from the field.  He said as horses did not appear to be making ground when having to make a sustained run around the field, he had been asked to obtain inside runs if possible on ELECTRONIC PHOENIX.  He added whilst the horse was further from the main body of the field than had been hoped, he had to wait until METALLIC STAR shifted out after the 600 Metres before he could commence to improve his position.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that it had been envisaged that SEA WARRIOR, from its good draw, would be able to settle in about 5th or 6th position.  He said SEA WARRIOR showed good early speed and making the turn into the Back Straight was able to obtain a trailing position behind the leader GLORY HORSIE.  He said he had intended to hold this position inside TRAVEL NUMBER ONE and behind GLORY HORSIE, however, when making the turn after the 700 Metres SEA WARRIOR came off the bridle and appeared to him not to be completely comfortable in the conditions.  He said he slapped the horse down the shoulder with the whip in the right hand near the 650 Metres in an endeavour for SEA WARRIOR to hold its positon and prevent TRAVEL NUMBER ONE from shifting in.  He said he felt that to hold its position behind GLORY HORSIE, he would have had to ride SEA WARRIOR aggressively at this time as the horse was not maintaining its position despite being given a slap down the shoulder.  He added he did not believe it was in the best interests for the horse to be aggressively ridden at this time and therefore he elected to allow TRAVEL NUMBER ONE to cross SEA WARRIOR near the 500 Metres.  He said he felt that SEA WARRIORï¿½ï¿½s best opportunity to finish off the race would be to not have it off the bridle mid race.  The Stewards advised N Rawiller that whilst they accepted he had slapped the horse down the shoulder near the 650 Metres, in their opinion, he should have made more of an effort to maintain his position given that it was at a critical stage of the race.  N Rawiller was advised that, wherever circumstances permit, he rides his mounts in such a manner so as to ensure that they are able to hold advantageous positions.
A veterinary inspection of FILL POWER immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained a small cut to the right hind pastern.  The performance of FILL POWER, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FILL POWER will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the improved performance of EMPEROR VICTORY, Trainer Y S Tsui stated that at its last start he formed the opinion that EMPEROR VICTORY was somewhat timid when racing amongst other horses and for this reason, with Apprentice H N Wong engaged, he believed that there was an opportunity for the horse with a light weight to be ridden for speed.  He said he anticipated that were EMPEROR VICTORY able to obtain the lead in this race, it would perform better.

A short distance after the start, FORTUNE BO BO shifted out and bumped WAH MAY BABY.
From the outside barriers, TRAVEL AMBASSADOR and SMART DECLARATION were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After the 800 Metres, BAD BOY improved to be racing close to the heels of BRILLIANT PROPOSAL (E da Silva) which was being directed out as it was being crossed by TOP BONUS.  As a consequence, BAD BOY shifted out abruptly away from the heels of that horse, resulting in MINT MASTER being hampered and taken wider.  FORTUNE BO BO, which was following MINT MASTER, was steadied away from the heels of that horse in consequence.  E da Silva was advised to exercise more care in similar circumstance.
Passing the 750 Metres, MR RIGHT shifted out and bumped WAH MAY BABY.  WAH MAY BABY and MR RIGHT then raced tight for some distance.
Making the turn after the 600 Metres, BRILLIANT PROPOSAL got its head on the side and shifted out towards the heels of MR RIGHT.  BAD BOY, which was racing outside BRILLIANT PROPOSAL and travelling keenly, was shifted out away from the heels of that horse and bumped MINT MASTER, causing both horses to become unbalanced.  ARCHIPPUS which was following BRILLIANT PROPOSAL, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse in consequence.  BAD BOY then got its head on the side and shifted out further, resulting in the horse losing ground.  FORTUNE BO BO, which was following, was shifted out abruptly away from the heels of BAD BOY.
Near the 450 Metres, BAD BOY and FORTUNE BO BO raced tight.

When questioned, E da Silva stated that he had been asked to lead on BRILLIANT PROPOSAL which he was riding for the first occasion tonight, however, if the pace of the race was good in the early stages, it was acceptable for him to take a trailing position.  He said BRILLIANT PROPOSAL began well and he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position inside TOP BONUS.  He said TOP BONUS was able to obtain a forward position with relative ease and he felt that he would have had to ride BRILLIANT PROPOSAL along for some distance in the early stages to maintain its position inside TOP BONUS as that horse appeared to be travelling well.  He added therefore he elected to take a trailing position behind TOP BONUS after the 800 Metres.  He said when he allowed TOP BONUS to cross, BRILLIANT PROPOSAL shifted ground on a number of occasions. 
A veterinary inspection of BAD BOY and MR RIGHT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, J Moreira (LUCKY YEAR) stated that, from barrier 10, it was hoped that the horse may be able to obtain a trailing position behind the leader with cover if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages, however, HAPPY YEAH YEAH, which was drawn to the inside of LUCKY YEAR, was also vigorously ridden along and as LUCKY YEAR did not have sufficient speed to cross that horse, he elected to steady it approaching the 1100 Metres in order to obtain cover behind HAPPY YEAH YEAH.  He added after the 700 Metres LUCKY YEAR was left racing without cover, however, in the Straight finished off the race strongly after having to be ridden further back in the field than had been intended.

When questioned, J Moreira stated that after obtaining a good run throughout the race, RED MARVEL was badly held up for clear running rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight when LOOKS LIKE THE CAT, which had been leading, commenced to weaken back through the field.  He said it was not until near the 250 Metres that RED MARVEL was able to obtain clear running, however, by this time the horse had lost its momentum.  He said whilst RED MARVEL may have appeared somewhat disappointing after its failure to close off the race strongly, he felt that RED MARVEL's run was better than it appeared as the horse was not able to pick up after losing momentum rounding the turn.  A veterinary inspection of RED MARVEL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, Y T Cheng stated that as ABLE DEED was racing over 1650 Metres at Happy Valley for the first time, he had been asked to ensure that he obtained cover on the horse.  He said it was hoped that ABLE DEED would be able to obtain a position in about midfield or just slightly worse than midfield.  He said in accordance with his instructions he steadied ABLE DEED in the early stages to take up a trailing position behind HEROIC GURU which was then steadied which resulted in ABLE DEED racing slightly further back than had been intended.  He added it was stressed to him that ABLE DEED should obtain cover in the race as this would afford the horse the best opportunity to finish off.  The Stewards will interview Trainer J Moore at the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 13 March 2016 regarding the instructions given to Jockey Cheng.

When questioned, B Prebble stated that after FOREST COLOURS began well, the horse became badly unbalanced and appeared to lose its action behind.  He said as he felt that the horse had broken down, he immediately eased it down.  After reviewing the videos, it was established that THUNDER WINNER, which was drawn immediately inside FOREST COLOURS, shifted out at the start and its left front leg struck the right hind leg of FOREST COLOURS, resulting in the horse becoming badly unbalanced in its action which led to Jockey Prebble forming the view that the horse had possibly broken down.  A veterinary inspection of FOREST COLOURS immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained small wounds over the right hind cannon and pastern, however, due to the fractious nature of the horse, an endoscopic examination was unable to be performed.

He said it was explained to him that the horse had not begun well in a number of recent starts and he was asked to give it a good warm up behind the barriers in order to assist it to jump well today.  He said in accordance with his instructions he trotted the horse up behind the barriers, however, as the start was effected HONEST HORSE lifted its front feet off the ground and was consequently slow to begin.  He added he rode HONEST HORSE vigorously in the early stages in an endeavour to have it obtain a more forward position, however, HONEST HORSE did not show any early speed and consequently raced in a position behind midfield.  He said HONEST HORSE travelled only fairly in the run and then in the Straight hung in under pressure and proved difficult to ride.  He said he rode the horse along to improve inside DILLY in the early part of the Straight, however, that horse shifted ground on a number of occasions and as HONEST HORSE was hanging in, he was not able to get the horse to improve to be racing inside DILLY.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BEAUTY ONLY, N Callan stated that after having ridden the horse throughout most of its career in Hong Kong he is of the opinion that BEAUTY ONLY is best suited on tracks where there is no give.  He said today whilst it was good racing surface, there was some cut in the track and this was the only reason he could attribute to the horse's failure to close off the race.

When questioned, C Schofield (HO LEE HORSE) stated that he had been instructed to ride the horse similarly to its last start, that is to obtain a forward position.  He said however that it was anticipated there may have been more early speed in today's race than at its most recent start and if this was the case and he was not able to lead on HO LEE HORSE, he was advised it was acceptable to have the horse positioned with cover as close to the lead as possible.  He said he rode his mount along in the early stages to comply with his instructions, however, the horse did not show the same early speed that it did at its last start.  He said he rode the horse more vigorously than he did at its most recent start in the early stages, however, on that occasion HO LEE HORSE was able to obtain the lead easily.  He added passing the winning post on the first occasion he steadied HO LEE HORSE to obtain a trailing position, however, due to the circumstances of the race, it was left racing without cover near the 1000 Metres when CHEERFUL FRAME shifted out.  He said although the tempo of the race along the Back Straight was only fair, he did not consider riding his mount forward at this time as he had made some use of the horse in the early stages and he did not believe HO LEE HORSE was travelling well enough to sustain a run in an endeavour to clear horses to its inside and then still be able to finish off its race.

Throughout the race, REWARDING FLYER travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, C Y Ho (FLYING MONKEY) stated that he had been instructed to ride the horse in a midfield position with cover.  He said unlike at its previous two starts, the horse began extremely well today which he did not expect.  He said as he had been asked to ride the horse with cover, he elected to restrain his mount in the early stages and endeavour to obtain a trailing position in about midfield.  He said however that FLYING MONKEY travelled keenly and would not come back underneath him and when REWARDING FLYER was hard ridden to his inside, he was not able to shift FLYING MONKEY in to obtain cover and this resulted in the horse having to race wide and without cover throughout the race.  Trainer W Y So confirmed that he had instructed Jockey Ho to obtain a position in about midfield as he felt that the make-up of the field and the horse's wide draw would allow the horse the best opportunity to obtain this position.  He said he did not anticipate FLYING MONKEY beginning as well as it did today, however, given the manner in which he had asked Jockey Ho to ride the horse, he was comfortable that Jockey Ho had attempted to carry out his instructions even though the horse began very well today.  Mr So was advised that he must ensure that he provides his riders with the opportunity to show judgement in a race to accommodate the changing circumstances that can often occur during a race.  Jockey Ho was also advised that in the circumstances he should have shown more judgement and initiative than he did on this occasion given the manner in which the horse had begun.

As such, the Stewards permitted T H So to be substituted as the rider of KING WINSA.  For this declaration error, Trainer W Y So was fined $2,000.
After being mounted, OCTAL LUCK became fractious, resulting in B Prebble being dislodged without incident.
A FAST ONE, which was fractious in the barriers, began awkwardly and consequently was slow to begin.
OCTAL LUCK shifted out at the start and hampered KING WINSA.

For the majority of the race, OCTAL LUCK travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the improved performance of OCTAL LUCK, Trainer A Lee stated that, in his opinion, the horse had benefited significantly by being down in grade tonight.  He said prior to being withdrawn at the barriers at its last intended start on 17 February 2016, the horse had barrier trialed well when ridden by B Prebble who also rode the horse tonight.  He said since its last race start on 25 October 2015 he had freshened OCTAL LUCK and removed the blinkers from the horse in the hope that it would be able to settle better.  He added the horse had performed well without the blinkers applied in its trials in the lead up to tonight's race.  He said having in mind the manner in which OCTAL LUCK finished off the race, he feels that it performs best when fresh and therefore it is his intention to keep its work programme similar to that leading up to this race.  Mr Lee was advised that his comments would be reported, however, he was reminded of the obligation to ensure that, wherever possible, horses race in a consistent manner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PERFECT SMART, Z Purton, who was riding the horse for the first time tonight, stated that the horse appeared ""timid"" when racing amongst other horses.  He said he noted that at its last start when successful, PERFECT SMART raced amongst horses, however, in his opinion, it was reluctant to stretch out tonight when racing behind and inside horses on the rail.  He said in the Straight PERFECT SMART did not close off the race as he anticipated.  A veterinary inspection of PERFECT SMART immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

In this incident, MANFUL STAR lost its left hind plate.  A short distance later, SMART GAIN shifted in abruptly away from the heels of MANFUL STAR when racing tight inside PERPETUAL JOYANCE.  This resulted in CAREFREE LET GO, which was improving its position, having to be steadied away from the heels of SMART GAIN.  N Callan was advised that the Stewards accepted that there were a number of circumstances which contributed to this incident, however, in similar circumstances he must ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground when not properly clear of other runners.
Passing the 500 Metres, CAREFREE LET GO momentarily raced tight inside PERPETUAL JOYANCE which got its head on the side and lay in.
Throughout the race, GLORY SUNSHINE travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of PERPETUAL JOYANCE, J Moreira stated that it had been intended for the horse to be ridden in a forward position as it was at its only other race start over the course and distance.  He said after being crowded at the start PERPETUAL JOYANCE became unbalanced and then did not show the same early speed as it did last start.  He said this resulted in PERPETUAL JOYANCE racing further back in the field than had been intended.  He added after shifting in to race behind MANFUL STAR approaching the 600 Metres, PERPETUAL JOYANCE was reluctant to maintain its position behind that horse which required him to ride his mount along in an endeavour to maintain its position.  He said PERPETUAL JOYANCE continued to be reluctant to fully stretch out until after straightening when the field opened up at which time the horse then finished off the race fairly.

After this, TRENDIFUL became unbalanced after making contact with YO-YO DA, got its head on the side and shifted out abruptly across the heels of PURE MOMENTUM and was consequently checked.  When TRENDIFUL was checked, FABIO shifted out abruptly away from the heels of that horse and bumped STEP FASTER, taking that horse wider.  The Stewards advised Apprentice Chiong that whilst, in the opinion of the Stewards, the degree of the shift of PURE MOMENTUM was not such that a careless riding charge should be issued, nonetheless she was severely reprimanded and told that she must leave comfortable racing room for runners to her inside in similar circumstances.  Z Purton stated that after this TRENDIFUL gave ground abruptly and did not appear comfortable in its action.  A veterinary inspection of TRENDIFUL immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of TRENDIFUL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.

He said MIGHTY EQUUS was down in body weight tonight and appeared to appreciate the good tempo of the race which allowed it to finish off strongly.  He said he was also of the view that MIGHTY EQUUS benefitted by being able to make its run inside horses as it is his opinion that the horse performs best when able to be ridden in this manner.  He added based on its barrier trial in preparation for this race, he anticipated that the horse would improve and advised the connections accordingly.  Having considered this matter, the Stewards took no further action.

Passing the 400 Metres, JOYFUL TRINITY was shifted to the inside of CAGA FORCE in an attempt to obtain clear running inside that horse.  As JOYFUL TRINITY was attempting to shift to the inside of CAGA FORCE, that horse shifted in, resulting in JOYFUL TRINITY being held up for clear running until passing the 300 Metres.

Near the 100 Metres, CAGA FORCE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of SPICY SURE.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered if BULLISH SMART had been afforded a fair start.  Evidence was taken from Jockey C Y Ho and from Mr T Speechley, Deputy Starter who started this race.  After viewing the videos, it was established that after being loaded into the barriers, despite the best endeavours of C Y Ho and the barrier attendant, BULLISH SMART got its head down and to the left with its head remaining in that position until the start of the race was effected.  As the Stewards were of the view that BULLISH SMART had not been afforded a fair start, that horse was ruled to be a non-runner.
When questioned regarding his riding of TRAVEL RENYI in the early part of the Straight, C Schofield stated that he had been racing inside RAPPER DRAGON for some distance leading up to the Home Straight.  He said he did consider, passing the 600 Metres, steadying and shifting out to be racing behind RAPPER DRAGON as he was concerned that he may not be able to obtain clear running in the Straight if he continued to race inside that horse.  He said however that due to the circumstances of the race he was not able to shift out and consequently was left positioned inside of that horse and behind HARRIER JET at the entrance to the Straight.  He added he was held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight due to CAGA FORCE maintaining its position to the inside and in advance of TRAVEL RENYI.  He said however that horse shifted in after the 350 Metres which presented a run to the inside of HARRIER JET.  He said he did consider improving to the inside of that horse, however, he was aware that HARRIER JET had previously hung in during one of its race starts in Hong Kong.  He said he was also mindful that PRECISION KING, which was racing outside the leader, may not have finished off the race and therefore he elected to remain racing behind HARRIER JET and wait for a run to eventuate to the outside of that horse.  He further stated he had hoped that RAPPER DRAGON would improve its position quicker than it did, however, it was not until passing the 250 Metres that he was able to shift TRAVEL RENYI out from behind HARRIER JET to obtain clear running between that horse and RAPPER DRAGON.  Having particular regard to the previous racing manners of HARRIER JET, the Stewards accepted C Schofield's explanation.

For the majority of the race, SPICY DOUBLE travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Y T Cheng stated that it was felt that, from barrier 11, GOLD PRECIOUS would be able to obtain the lead with relative ease.  He said however that after beginning well, he had to ride GOLD PRECIOUS along for a considerable distance to clear runners to its inside as GOLD PRECIOUS took some time to muster speed.  He said near the 1200 Metres he was able to shift GOLD PRECIOUS in to race on the rail and he immediately commenced to steady the tempo on the horse.  He said however that after being ridden along in the early stages, GOLD PRECIOUS proved difficult to settle and near the 1100 Metres he had to take another hold of GOLD PRECIOUS in an endeavour to have it travel at a more steady tempo.  He added despite this GOLD PRECIOUS continued to race keenly and he was not able to restrain the horse further, resulting in it running quicker than had been anticipated.
A veterinary inspection of GOLD TALENT immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse's trachea.
MASSIVE POWER, GO-GETTER and WHO'STHEDUDE were sent for sampling.

From the 900 Metres, TRIBAL GLORY gave ground abruptly and finished distanced.  A veterinary inspection of TRIBAL GLORY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of TRIBAL GLORY was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, TRIBAL GLORY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Passing the 800 Metres, GLORIOUS VICTORY became unbalanced when having to be shifted out abruptly away from the heels of TRIBAL GLORY which shifted out when giving ground abruptly.
For some distance after the 550 Metres, STRIKE EAGLE was taken back through the field by COOL PAL as that horse weakened abruptly.
After the 500 Metres, GOOD FIT and LOYAL CRAFTSMAN raced tight as both horses improved into tight running between COOL PAL which was continuing to give ground abruptly and CASA MASTER.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to lead on COOL PAL if possible, however, if the horse missed the start as it did at its most recent start, he was instructed to have COOL PAL racing where it was comfortable.  He said COOL PAL began well and he was able to obtain the lead from barrier 1 in the early stages.  He said making the turn approaching the 2000 Metres TRIBAL GLORY commenced to improve its position around COOL PAL and as he did not want COOL PAL to be crossed, he had to ride his mount along to maintain the lead.  He said this resulted in this part of the race being run at a fast tempo.  He said after the 1700 Metres he was able to steady COOL PAL and the horse was then able to travel at a more generous tempo.  He added after the 1200 Metres, being aware that a number of races over the extended distances at Happy Valley had seen horses making mid-race moves, he allowed COOL PAL to continue in the lead at a quicker than normal tempo to ensure that no other runner was enticed to be ridden for the lead.  He said whilst he was not aware that he had opened up a significant margin on the field, he was aware that the race was being run at that time faster than normal, however, he was reluctant to steady the tempo as this may encourage other runners to improve their positions.  He added prior to the 700 Metres COOL PAL came under pressure and although the sections of the race had been run quicker than standard, he believed the manner in which COOL PAL weakened indicated to him that the horse must have been experiencing an internal issue.  Mr A Lee, the trainer of COOL PAL, confirmed the instructions and agreed that COOL PAL had been required to go quicker than hoped, particularly after the 1200 Metres.  M L Yeung was advised that his riding of  COOL PAL between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres, particularly given the earlier sectionals of the race, had lacked judgement and that as an experienced rider he would be expected to ride his mounts in such a manner in the future so as to ensure that they are afforded every opportunity to finish off their race.  A veterinary inspection of COOL PAL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of COOL PAL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, COOL PAL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When ULTIMATE GLORY became badly unbalanced passing the 50 Metres, it shifted in, resulting in AMAZINGLY being badly crowded for room and GIANT STARS, which was racing to the inside of AMAZINGLY, being checked.  Consequently neither AMAZINGLY nor GIANT STARS was able to be ridden out to the end of the race and also G Mosse was not able to ride ULTIMATE GLORY out to the end of the race.  As this was the second consecutive occasion that the Stewards have reported that ULTIMATE GLORY had become unbalanced near the finishing line, Mr K L Man, the trainer of ULTIMATE GLORY, was advised that the horse must barrier trial to the satisfaction of the Stewards on two consecutive occasions before being permitted to race again and that ULTIMATE GLORY will not be permitted to be entered for any race conducted under lights.  The Stewards further ruled that ULTIMATE GLORY will not be permitted to be ridden by an apprentice jockey until further notice.  Mr Man advised the Stewards that he would consider removing the shadow roll from the gear of ULTIMATE GLORY given the horse had raced with this gear at its two most recent starts.

                ELITE PRIDE and HASTILY FEET bumped at the start.
RAINBOW GOLD was slow to begin.
Despite being aggressively ridden in the early and middle stages, PENNY LANE failed to muster speed and consequently travelled back in the field.
From a wide barrier, TEAM SWEET was steadied in the early stages and  shifted across behind runners.
After the 1000 Metres, VOLITATION was left racing wide and without cover.
Near the 950 Metres, TEAM SWEET got its head up after having to be steadied when attempting to improve between PENNY LANE and RAINBOW GOLD where there was insufficient room.  In this incident, RAINBOW GOLD was hampered when bumped by TEAM SWEET.  STARRY STARLIES, which was following, was hampered in consequence.
Near the 800 Metres, TEAM SWEET was checked when crowded for room between ELITE PRIDE and RAINBOW GOLD which got its head on the side and shifted out rounding the turn.
After the race, B Prebble (HASTILY FEET) stated that his mount became unbalanced in its action near the 200 Metres and as he had concern for the horse's welfare, he eased it down from this point.  After viewing the video, it was established that HASTILY FEET became unbalanced after being galloped on by PENNY LANE when that horse was taken out across the heels of HASTILY FEET by GERONIMO MEADOW (N Rawiller) which, after being held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight, was shifted out to obtain clear running.  N Rawiller was reprimanded.  A veterinary inspection of HASTILY FEET immediately following the race found the horse to have sustained a small cut outside the right hind cannon.
Passing the 200 Metres, MOTIF was awkwardly placed close to the heels of SILVER GATSBY.  Then passing the 100 Metres, MOTIF momentarily raced in restricted room inside SILVER GATSBY which shifted in marginally.
A veterinary inspection of MOTIF immediately following the race found the horse, which had previously been reported as a ""roarer"", was again making an abnormal respiratory noise.

                After leaving the Parade Ring but prior to entering the track, the bridle fitted to FANCY MUSIC broke, requiring it to be replaced.  FANCY MUSIC then proved reluctant to enter the track and subsequently to proceed to the Start.  Before being permitted to race again, FANCY MUSIC will be required to barrier trial to the satisfaction of the Stewards and be able to be ridden to the Start in a timely manner.  After the race, the Stewards inspected the relevant piece of equipment and were satisfied that it was in overall good condition.
GLACIER BLUE began only fairly.
SOCKET KING, KING'S DAGGER and FANCY MUSIC were steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Near the 350 Metres, SOCKET KING was shifted abruptly to the outside of DYNAMIC VOYAGE to obtain clear running.
Throughout the race, ENERGETIC CLASS travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that after having to ride PROMPT EXPRESS along from a wide barrier in the early stages, he was able to cross RIGHT CALL and assume the lead on the rail after the 1100 Metres.  He said he immediately attempted to steady the tempo on PROMPT EXPRESS as the horse, which it had done at its previous starts, travelled keenly and proved very difficult to settle.  He said this resulted in the middle stages of the race being run at a quicker tempo than he had hoped, however, in his opinion, he was not able to do any more to have the horse travel more comfortably in the lead.  He said because of the manner in which PROMPT EXPRESS had raced in the middle stages, the horse was then not able to finish off the race.  Apprentice Wong was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that after obtaining the lead he had attempted to steady the tempo, he should, wherever possible, make every endeavour to have his mounts travel so that they are able to finish off their race as best as they can.  A veterinary inspection of PROMPT EXPRESS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

After the 900 Metres, REAL FIT raced tight outside PERPETUAL JOYANCE which, despite the efforts of its rider, got its head on the side and shifted out away from SMILING GLORY.  Near the 800 Metres, REAL FIT became unbalanced when momentarily crowded for room outside PERPETUAL JOYANCE which, when racing greenly, continued to race with its head on the side and lay out.  Then near the 750 Metres, PERPETUAL JOYANCE shifted in across the heels of SMILING GLORY.

On arrival at the Start, it was noted that AMAZING ALWAYS had lost its left front plate.  After being replated, AMAZING ALWAYS was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.
DANEWIN EXPRESS and FLYING MACHINE began awkwardly.
BOLD STITCH and TEN SPEED were crowded for room on jumping between AMAZING ALWAYS and SNOW SLIDER which shifted in.  In this incident, AMAZING ALWAYS became unbalanced after being bumped by BOLD STITCH.
When being steadied in the early stages, MASTER PINNACLE travelled keenly and got its head up on a number of occasions.
From a wide barrier, PEARL FURU was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After the 600 Metres, MASTER PINNACLE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of AMAZING ALWAYS.
IMPERIAL SEAL had some difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
TEN SPEED was badly held up for clear running until after the 300 Metres.
Close to the finishing line, IMPERIAL SEAL raced close to the heels of DANEWIN EXPRESS and consequently was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
When questioned regarding his riding of SNOW SLIDER in the early stages, H W Lai stated that he had been asked to lead on the horse if possible, however, if the circumstances of the race meant that he was unable to do so, he should attempt to obtain a position with cover behind the speed.  He said SNOW SLIDER began well and he initially rode his mount along to take up a forward position.  He said shortly after the start he noted that both BUSINESS AS USUAL and TRENDY WORLD were being hard ridden to obtain forward positions and further that RAGING BULL, which was drawn to the outside of SNOW SLIDER, was also being aggressively ridden.  He said he felt that he would have had to make considerable use of the horse in an attempt to clear runners to his inside and therefore he elected, after the 1300 Metres, to attempt to obtain a trailing position behind TRENDY WORLD which was still being ridden along.  He said due to the circumstances of the race, after the 1300 Metres, he was not able to obtain a position with cover and he was left racing to the outside of TRENDY WORLD.  He added approaching the 1200 Metres he again commenced to ride his mount along in an endeavour to see whether SNOW SLIDER would have sufficient speed to cross TRENDY WORLD, however, it was apparent to him that TRENDY WORLD, BUSINESS AS USUAL and RAGING BULL were all showing more speed than SNOW SLIDER.  He said approaching the 1000 Metres he again rode his mount along in an attempt to obtain a more forward position so as not to travel wide and without cover, however, SNOW SLIDER did not show sufficient speed to do so and consequently was left racing in a position three wide and without cover throughout the middle stages.  Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of SNOW SLIDER, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Lai and after viewing the video was satisfied that the circumstances of the race and the fact that SNOW SLIDER had not shown as much early speed as he anticipated had resulted in the horse travelling wide and without cover.  Mr Yiu further stated that he was satisfied with H W Lai's riding of the horse.  H W Lai was advised that the Stewards were satisfied that he had made some effort to lead on SNOW SLIDER, however, in the circumstances they were of the view that he could have made a more concerted effort to establish whether SNOW SLIDER would have sufficient speed to cross runners to its inside and lead.  He was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts, wherever possible, in accordance with his instructions.
When questioned, C Schofield stated that after being placed in the barriers, G-ONE LEADER stood well, however, as the start was effected became fractious and sat back, resulting in the horse being slow to begin.  He said he then pushed G-ONE LEADER along in the early stages to make up lost ground, however, the horse was reluctant to improve its position.  He said this resulted in G-ONE LEADER racing much further back in the field than had been intended.  He added rounding the Home Turn he was reluctant to shift G-ONE LEADER out which would have required the horse to cover more ground given that he had to make use of his horse in the early stages in an attempt to make up lost ground, therefore he elected to ride G-ONE LEADER for luck in the Straight in order to save ground.  He said after being held up for clear running behind IMPERIAL SEAL for some distance after the 300 Metres, his mount then closed off the race strongly over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of G-ONE LEADER immediately following the race found that there was blood at the left nostril of the horse, however, an endoscopic examination conducted on G-ONE LEADER found it not to have bled.
BOLD STITCH, RAGING BULL and MELLIFLUENT were sent for sampling.
<29/3/2016  Additional Veterinary Report>G-ONE LEADER, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer.  He said at that time he found that there was blood at the left nostril of the horse, however, an endoscopic examination conducted on G-ONE LEADER found it not to have bled.  G-ONE LEADER was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer C H Yip this morning.  He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its left front leg with a sore fetlock.  Before being allowed to race again, G-ONE LEADER will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

EAGLE POWER shifted in at the start and bumped JOLLY GENE.
From wide barriers, FULL GLORY, ADMIRAL LORD and ASHKIYR were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After passing the winning post on the first occasion, HAPPY ROCKY momentarily raced tight inside JOLLY GENE which got its head on the side and shifted in away from TRIUMPHANT DRAGON.
After the 1700 Metres, EAGLE POWER was left racing wide and without cover and after the 1200 Metres was allowed to stride forward to race outside the lead.
After the 1000 Metres, LUCKY OMENS was left racing wide and without cover.
After the 800 Metres, ADMIRAL LORD was eased down.  A veterinary inspection of ADMIRAL LORD immediately following the race revealed that the horse was displaying an irregular heart rhythm.  Before being allowed to race again, ADMIRAL LORD will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and MIDNITE PROMISE raced tight as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out into clear running.  TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was then held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight.
Passing the 200 Metres, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and EAGLE POWER were crowded for room between UNIQUE HAPPIEST which was taken out by HAPPILABABY and MIDNITE PROMISE which, when giving ground, got its head on the side and shifted in away from HAPPY ROCKY.
FULL GLORY was badly held up for clear running from near the 300 Metres until approaching the 100 Metres.
CHINA DELIGHT was held up for clear running from prior to the 200 Metres until after the 100 Metres.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, C Schofield stated that in accordance with his instructions he obtained a forward position on the horse.  He said the tempo of the race in the early and middle stags was quicker than he anticipated, nonetheless MIDNITE PROMISE continued to travel satisfactorily and he was able to obtain a position with cover behind EAGLE POWER when that horse improved around MIDNITE PROMISE after the 1200 Metres.  He said MIDNITE PROMISE came under pressure after the 600 Metres and after becoming unbalanced when bumped by TRIUMPHANT DRAGON rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, MIDNITE PROMISE then gave ground and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of MIDNITE PROMISE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, a favourite for this race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MIDNITE PROMISE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
The Stewards questioned K Teetan regarding his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after the 600 Metres.  K Teetan stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 2, to take a trailing position behind the anticipated leader of the race UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said after being able to obtain this position, ALLCASH then travelled well during the race.  He said prior to the 500 Metres he was racing behind TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and slightly away from the running rail.  He said when TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out passing the 500 Metres, he looked to his inside to ensure that no runner had improved to his inside and after doing so he shifted ALLCASH back towards the rail.  He said rounding the Home turn and at the entrance to the Straight he was aware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST was racing near the rail and he noted that EAGLE POWER, which was racing to the outside of that horse, had come under heavy pressure.  He said as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was attempting to shift MIDNITE PROMISE out at this stage, he felt the most likely avenue to improve was advancing to the outside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST when EAGLE POWER commenced to give ground.  He said therefore he shifted ALLCASH out with TRIUMPHANT DRAGON in order to improve into the run when EAGLE POWER gave ground.  He said as he was doing this he was initially unaware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST had shifted away from the rail which had created a tight run to the inside of that horse.  He added passing the 400 Metres he looked to his inside to ascertain whether it was available for him to shift ALLCASH to the inside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST to take advantage of that run, however, at this time he received a loud call from Z Purton, the rider of HAPPILABABY, and as he could see that horse improving to his inside, he did not believe that it was available to him to shift ALLCASH in as he was concerned that he would have caused interference to that horse and therefore, on safety grounds, he remained racing one horse off the rail behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said HAPPILABABY then advanced quickly to the inside of ALLCASH and he had another look to his inside near the 350 Metres to ascertain how quickly HAPPILABABY was improving its position so that he could shift across behind that horse and follow it through inside UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  Mr A T Millard, the trainer of ALLCASH, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Teetan.  He said after the race he questioned K Teetan regarding him not shifting in from behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST after the 400 Metres as he believed that it may have been available for Jockey Teetan to have done so at this time.  After viewing the video of the race, Mr Millard confirmed that it was available for Jockey Teetan to shift ALLCASH in at that time and stated that, in his opinion, Jockey Teetan had erred in failing to immediately shift ALLCASH in after the 400 Metres prior to HAPPILABABY improving to the inside of ALLCASH.  After viewing the video, K Teetan conceded that he had made an error of judgement by not shifting in after the 400 Metres, however, he reiterated that during the race he believed that HAPPILABABY was in a position to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH.  After considering the evidence and the circumstances of his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after entering the Straight, the Stewards advised Jockey Teetan that they had considered issuing a charge against him for breaching a significant Rule of Racing, however, in the circumstances, having regard to the manner in which HAPPILABABY improved quickly to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH, the Stewards believed that it was not appropriate for him to be charged over this aspect of his riding.  Nonetheless he was severely reprimanded and advised that he must ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner as to be able to improve their position as runs become available so that there can be no doubts as to his intentions to win or to obtain the best possible placing.  A veterinary inspection of ALLCASH immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Near the 1000 Metres, CLUB LIFE and THE SHOW raced tight inside BERLINI which was improving its position.
G Mosse (BERLINI) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that approaching the 900 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of LAUGH OUT LOUD, causing that horse to be unnecessarily crowded for room and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  G Mosse was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 12 May 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 1 May 2016.  In addition, G Mosse was fined $75,000 in lieu of a suspension for a period incorporating 3 further racedays.

Approaching the 300 Metres, FORMULA WON and MAGNETISM bumped as FORMULA WON attempted to shift out into clear running between MAGNETISM and BEAUTY PRINCE.
For the majority of the race, CITRON SPIRIT travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Trainer D J Hall stated that BERLINI has been getting back in its races and then not being able to make up ground sufficiently in recent starts to be in contention of winning the race over the concluding stages.  He said, from the outside barrier today, over 1600 Metres, he felt that there was an opportunity for BERLINI to take up a more forward position and as it was carrying top weight he did not believe that the tempo of the race was such that the horse would be able to make up sufficient ground in the Straight were it to be ridden from the rear of the field.  He said therefore he instructed G Mosse to allow BERLINI to travel into a forward position and if another horse was able to lead he could take a trailing position, otherwise he should sit outside whatever horse was leading.  He said due to the circumstances of the race, passing the 1200 Metres BERLINI was left racing wide and for this reason G Mosse then allowed the horse to improve its position into the lead.  After considering Mr Hallâs evidence and after reviewing the circumstances of the race including a number of BERLINIâs recent races, the Stewards took no further action.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BEAUTY PRINCE, J Moreira stated that his mount over-raced badly in the early and middle stages and was left racing wide and without cover after the 1000 Metres.  He said because of this the horse came off the bridle after the 600 Metres and then did not finish off the race, however, he believed that the horseâs finishing position was directly attributable to the manner in which it raced in the early and middle stages.  A veterinary inspection of BEAUTY PRINCE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

SOUTHCHINA COMMAND lost its left front plate on jumping.
Shortly after the start, HIGH SPEED METRO and ENDLESS LOVE, which were being steadied to obtain cover, were crowded for room between PLENTY OF SPEED and MR VANILLA which shifted in.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, DRAGON GLORY, which had been ridden along, was steadied away from the heels of SOUTHCHINA COMMAND (Apprentice K K Chiong) which shifted in when not properly clear.  Apprentice Chiong was reprimanded.  In this incident, DRAGON GLORY shifted in and bumped the hindquarters of FUNNY FORTUNE, resulting in that horse becoming unbalanced.
Approaching the 1300 Metres, PLENTY OF SPEED was awkwardly placed close to the heels of ORACLE.
Passing the 400 Metres, DRAGON GLORY and PLENTY OF SPEED both became unbalanced when crowded for room inside CASA JUNIOR (K C Ng) which, when commencing to give ground, got its head on the side and shifted in marginally.  K C Ng was advised that in similar circumstances he must make every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that approaching the 600 Metres SOUTHCHINA COMMAND was racing in a two wide position behind PLENTY OF SPEED.  She said passing the 600 Metres MR VANILLA improved quickly around SOUTHCHINA COMMAND after which she commenced to ride her mount along in an endeavour to follow MR VANILLA through.  She conceded that, after viewing the video and having regard to the tempo of the race in the early and middle stages, it may have been more advantageous for SOUTHCHINA COMMAND to shift to the outside of PLENTY OF SPEED which would have permitted SOUTHCHINA COMMAND the opportunity to improve whilst retaining cover behind CASA JUNIOR.  Apprentice Chiong was advised to, wherever possible, ensure that she places her mounts in advantageous positions as they become available.
When questioned, K C Ng stated that he had been asked to ride CASA JUNIOR in about 3rd or 4th position if possible.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion there was briefly an opportunity to shift in to race behind PLENTY OF SPEED one horse off the rail, however, that horse was steadied to allow ORACLE to improve to its outside and because of this he was not able to shift CASA JUNIOR in to race behind that horse.  He said this resulted in CASA JUNIOR being left racing wide and without cover.  He said passing the 1300 Metres he attempted to steady CASA JUNIOR to see if there was an opportunity to obtain a position behind PLENTY OF SPEED with cover, however, at this time CASA JUNIOR got its head up on a number of occasions when being steadied and therefore he allowed the horse to remain racing outside PLENTY OF SPEED.  He added although the tempo of the race was slow, he did not believe it would be in the best interests of CASA JUNIOR to be ridden forward at that time to take up a position close to the rail, therefore he allowed his mount to remain racing in a three wide position without cover outside PLENTY OF SPEED.  K C Ng was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, having in mind the slow sectionals of the early and middle stages, his riding of CASA JUNIOR had lacked judgement and initiative by not allowing the horse to improve its position to be racing close to the rail.  He was reprimanded regarding his riding of CASA JUNIOR and advised that in similar circumstances he should ride his mounts in such a manner so as to ensure that they do not cover unnecessary ground, particularly when the tempo of the race is slow. 
A veterinary inspection of MI SAVVY BOY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.
A veterinary inspection of DRAGON GLORY immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse's trachea.

                On arrival at the Start, OPTIMISM, which kicked a rail whilst parading, was examined by the Veterinary Officer and found to be suitable to race.
SGT ROCK began awkwardly and lost ground.
OPTIMISM was crowded for room on jumping between KING OF SMARTS which initially shifted in and WHISTLE BLOWER which shifted out and then shifted out further after becoming unbalanced when contacted on the hindquarters by OPTIMISM.
From the outside barriers, GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS and RUGBY DIAMOND were steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Making the turn after the 1100 Metres, GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS was steadied away from the heels of WHISTLE BLOWER which shifted out away from the heels of HURRY HURRY UP.
At the 600 Metres, GOOD VIEW DELIGHTS momentarily raced tight between EAGLE KING and WHISTLE BLOWER which shifted in marginally.
In the early part of the Straight, KING OF SMARTS lay in under pressure and proved reluctant to shift to the outside of FOREVER FUN.  KING OF SMARTS continued to lay in under pressure for the remainder of the race.
For the majority of the race, OPTIMISM raced with its head on the side and lay out whilst JUST PLEASANT travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of WHISTLE BLOWER, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that she had been asked to obtain a forward position on the horse if possible, however, WHISTLE BLOWER did not show sufficient early speed after becoming unbalanced shortly after the start.  She said she rode her mount along for some distance after the start in an endeavour to comply with her instructions, however, other runners were able to show more speed than WHISTLE BLOWER and this resulted in the horse having to race in about a midfield position.  She said in the early stages WHISTLE BLOWER was left racing wide and it was not until passing the 700 Metres that the horse was able to obtain a position with cover behind JUST PLEASANT.  She added that WHISTLE BLOWER came under pressure after the 500 Metres and then did not respond to her riding in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of WHISTLE BLOWER immediately following the race found that horse to have an abnormally elevated heart rate (post-race distress).  Before being allowed to race again, WHISTLE BLOWER will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of HURRY HURRY UP immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained a small cut to the inside of the right hind leg.
KING'S STEED and FOREVER FUN were sent for sampling.

A short distance later, LUCKY PROFIT shifted in when unbalanced, resulting in PEACE ON EARTH racing tight outside XINJIANG YARN which became unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by PEACE ON EARTH.
WORLD CITY was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Near the 1150 Metres, ANIMATION MASTER momentarily raced in restricted room between PEACE ON EARTH and WORLD CITY which was racing tight inside MR GINGER.
Making the turn after the 1100 Metres, WORLD CITY was shifted out after racing tight outside ANIMATION MASTER, resulting in MASSIVE MOVE being inconvenienced.
Near the 550 Metres, HAYMAKER was awkwardly placed inside the heels of IDYLLIC WIND which travelled wide and without cover until passing the 500 Metres.  LUCKY PROFIT, which was following HAYMAKER, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse in consequence.
Passing the 300 Metres, XIANJIANG YARN was momentarily awkwardly placed behind HASTA LA VISTA which was giving ground.
After the 300 Metres, PEACE ON EARTH and WORLD CITY raced tight as PEACE ON EARTH attempted to shift out.

                FAIRY EAGLE was withdrawn on 30.3.16 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (sore right fore fetlock) and was replaced by Standby Declared Starter SPEEDY WALLY (K Teetan).  Before being allowed to race again, FAIRY EAGLE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After being placed in the barriers, STRATUM POWER became fractious and reared on a number of occasions.  Then as the start was effected, STRATUM POWER again reared, resulting in the horse losing a significant amount of ground and subsequently finishing tailed out.  The performance of STRATUM POWER was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, STRATUM POWER will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
REAL GENEROUS was very slow to begin.
SPEEDY WALLY was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Passing the 1400 Metres, SPEEDY WALLY was very awkwardly placed close to the heels of CALIFORNIA CHERISH and shifted in, resulting in TELEPHATIA being momentarily crowded for room.  Then near the 1300 Metres, SPEEDY WALLY, which continued to be awkwardly placed close to the heels of CALIFORNIA CHERISH, shifted out abruptly away from the heels of that horse.
After the 1200 Metres, TELEPHATIA got its head up on a number of occasions when proving difficult to settle.
Passing the 1000 Metres, ROBUST MOMENTUM got its head up when racing close to the heels of SUPER SPRINTER.
Passing the 700 Metres, REAL GENEROUS was awkwardly placed close to the heels of SPEEDY WALLY.
Passing the 500 Metres, TELEPHATIA raced close to the heels of CALIFORNIA CHERISH.
K Teetan (SPEEDY WALLY) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the 50 Metres he failed to take sufficient measures to prevent his mount from shifting in, resulting in SPEEDY WALLY shifting in across the rightful running of REAL GENEROUS which was checked.  K Teetan was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Sunday, 17 April 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 10 April 2016.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into consideration Jockey Teetanâs good race riding record during the most recent 2014/2015 and current racing seasons.
Over the concluding stages, TELEPHATIA raced tight inside TEN SPEED which shifted in under pressure.
In the Straight, SPEEDY WALLY raced with its head on the side and hung in under pressure.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that he had been instructed to ride OSCAR MIRACLE positively in the early stages and take up a forward position if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode OSCAR MIRACLE vigorously out of the barriers, however, ROBUST MOMENTUM and SUPER SPRINTER showed superior speed to OSCAR MIRACLE.  He said as OSCAR MIRACLE was not showing as much early speed as anticipated, he elected, passing the winning post on the first occasion, to obtain a trailing position rather than continuing to ride his mount along.  He added shortly after shifting in to race on the rail behind ROBUST MOMENTUM, the pace of the race slackened appreciably, however, by this time he had already committed OSCAR MIRACLE to race behind ROBUST MOMENTUM.
When questioned, Y T Cheng (TEN SPEED) stated that, from barrier 10, he had been asked to shift the horse across behind runners and ride the horse quietly and save ground if possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he shifted TEN SPEED across initially behind SPEEDY WALLY and then was able to obtain a position racing on the rail following TELEPHATIA after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said in the early and middle stages TEN SPEED remained racing behind TELEPHATIA and near the 900 Metres became unbalanced when having to be checked away from the heels of that horse.  He said he continued to race behind TELEPHATIA and inside REAL GENEROUS until after making the turn passing the 600 Metres.  He said near the 550 Metres he rode his mount along to ensure it maintained its position behind TELEPHATIA and approaching the 400 Metres attempted to shift TEN SPEED from behind TELEPHATIA, however, he then elected to remain racing behind that horse until entering the Straight at which time he immediately shifted TEN SPEED to the outside of TELEPHATIA.  He added he then commenced to ride his mount along shortly after entering the Straight and placed it under pressure until the final stages of the race at which time he was obliged to put the whip away as TEN SPEED was laying in and he was aware that TELEPHATIA was awkwardly placed inside the heels of TEN SPEED over the concluding stages.  Trainer C W Chang advised the Stewards that, from a wide barrier, he had instructed Y T Cheng to shift TEN SPEED across behind runners as the horse does not have sufficient early speed to be able to be ridden along and cross runners to its inside.  He said whilst the horse had been able to obtain a midfield position in the past, this had been from more favourable barriers.  He said he also instructed Y T Cheng to attempt to improve his position prior to the Home Turn as the horse was backing up from a run last Monday and due to racing at Happy Valley with the rail in the C+3 position tonight, he felt the horse would need to be put in the race prior to the turn to be a competitive chance at the end of the race.  Mr Chang said after viewing the videos, he felt it was available for Jockey Cheng to shift TEN SPEED out from behind TELEPHATIA approaching the Home Turn in order to follow REAL GENEROUS which at that time was being ridden along to obtain a more forward position.  Y T Cheng was severely reprimanded regarding his riding of TEN SPEED from after the 500 Metres until entering the Straight.  Y T Cheng was advised that it was of concern that he had previously been spoken to this season regarding his handling of horses in races and that his riding of TEN SPEED at this stage of the race had again come under notice.  Mr Chang was advised that his explanation was noted.  A veterinary inspection of TEN SPEED immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

After the race, Apprentice Chiong stated that she had to continually niggle at WINNIE'S HORSE in an attempt to have it improve its position, however, WINNIE'S HORSE was reluctant to stretch out and remained somewhat detached from the field throughout the early and middle stages.  She added WINNIE'S HORSE gave limited response when placed under pressure and was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race.

C Schofield was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 21 April 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 13 April 2016.  In addition, C Schofield was fined $35,000 in lieu of a suspension for a period incorporating 1 further raceday.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into consideration that FOREST COLOURS and INNOVATIVE WINNER had initially raced tight inside ALL TIMES LUCKY which shifted in prior to the 250 Metres.
When questioned, B Prebble (FOREST COLOURS) stated that, from barrier 2, he rode his mount along in the early stages to have it as forward as possible, however, FOREST COLOURS was somewhat reluctant to stretch out.  He said approaching the 1200 Metres he was required to ride aggressively on FOREST COLOURS in an endeavour to have it improve its position to be racing closer behind INNOVATIVE WINNER.

When questioned regarding his riding of DUNDONNELL in the early stages, O Doleuze stated that it was considered there was not a great deal of speed engaged in the race and having regard to the fact that RAD was ridden more quietly at its most recent start over 1200 Metres, he was instructed that if DUNDONNELL began well, he should attempt to take up a forward position.  He was further advised that if the tempo of the race was not strong, it was acceptable for him to allow DUNDONNELL to lead.  He said as the start was effected DUNDONNELL lifted its front feet off the ground and then was bumped by RAD which shifted out.  He said he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position, however, RAD continued to maintain its position inside DUNDONNELL.  He said making the turn near the 900 Metres he steadied DUNDONNELL as it was no longer available to him to lead given that RAD was maintaining its position in the lead and travelling strongly.  O Doleuze stated that in retrospect he had erred in allowing DUNDONNELL to stride forward to race outside RAD given the manner in which the horse began, however, it was due to the tactics adopted on RAD at its most recent start which placed a doubt in his mind as to how that horse would be ridden.  Trainer C Fownes confirmed that he had instructed Jockey Doleuze to take up a forward position and lead if the circumstances in the early stages were that the race was not being run at a good tempo.  He said having regard to the manner in which DUNDONNELL began, he believed it would have been in the horse's best interests for it to take a trailing position behind RAD rather than contesting for the lead.  Having regard to the circumstances of this matter including the sectional times in the early stages, O Doleuze was advised that the Stewards were concerned with the manner in which DUNDONNELL was ridden, particularly given that the horse did not begin well.

Passing the 200 Metres, PERFECT TIMING got its head on the side and shifted out abruptly, resulting in BLAZING PASS being inconvenienced.
Throughout the race, GLORY SUNSHINE travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, K C Leung stated that he had been asked, from the outside barrier, to ensure that BE THERE AHEAD began well and then to shift the horse over to obtain cover.  He said he was told if he immediately shifted the horse across behind runners without allowing BE THERE AHEAD the opportunity to begin positively, the horse would get too far out of its ground in the early stages.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along briefly after the start and had hoped to obtain a position with cover behind MAGICAL BEAM and in advance of TRIPLE KING, however, TRIPLE KING maintained its position to the inside of BE THERE AHEAD and for this reason he was not able to initially obtain cover.  He added after the 1100 Metres it appeared as though that the gap may open up between MAGICAL BEAM and TRIPLE KING as that horse was struggling to maintain its position and therefore he attempted to shift BE THERE AHEAD to obtain this position, however, the pace of the race slackened at this time which resulted in the field compressing and he was consequently unable to obtain cover.  He said because of this BE THERE AHEAD was left racing very wide and without cover throughout the race and in the Straight gave ground.  A veterinary inspection of BE THERE AHEAD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of BE THERE AHEAD, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BE THERE AHEAD will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the performance of LEAN JOURNEY, C Schofield stated that he was able to obtain a trailing position behind GLORY SUNSHINE in the early stages and that LEAN JOURNEY initially travelled comfortably.  He said however that rounding the turns LEAN JOURNEY got its head on the side and lay out and he had to ride the horse along in an attempt to have it maintain its position.  He said when laying out, LEAN JOURNEY lost its action and he was not able to get the horse to balance up again.  He added due to the manner in which the horse raced in the middle stages, LEAN JOURNEY then gave ground in the Straight and performed disappointingly.  A veterinary inspection of LEAN JOURNEY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of THUNDERSTROKE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse's trachea.

SURREAL, which was fractious in the barriers, was slow to begin and then shortly after the start lost ground when checked away from the heels of PRECIOUS GEM.
As the start was effected, INTELLECTUAL GLIDE lifted its front feet off the ground and consequently began only fairly.
NOBLE BUDDIES began only fairly.
Shortly after the start, MIGHTY GAINS and PRECIOUS GEM bumped, resulting in both horses becoming unbalanced.
From an outside barrier, SEASONS KING was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners to obtain cover.
Passing the 250 Metres, SEASONS KING was shifted in away from the heels of MIGHTY GAINS.
After the 200 Metres, INTELLECTUAL GLIDE got its head on the side and shifted out under pressure.
When questioned, K C Ng stated that he had been instructed to ride PRECIOUS GEM positively in the early stages as the horse, at its last campaign when trained by another stable, raced well when ridden up on the speed.  He said he was asked not to make too much use of the horse to do so if possible, however, if the pace of the race was sufficient, it would be acceptable for him to lead.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode PRECIOUS GEM along in the early stages to ensure that the horse was able to take up a forward position and after the 1100 Metres commenced to steady PRECIOUS GEM to take a trailing position behind MIGHTY GAINS.  He said PRECIOUS GEM, which was first up today after a significant break, raced too keenly and he was not able to restrain the horse to take a trailing position behind MIGHTY GAINS.  He added because of this he was left racing in a three wide position without cover until after the 800 Metres.
When questioned, M Chadwick stated that he had been instructed to ride FOTOGENIC positively in the early stages and obtain a forward position.  He said if it was available to him to obtain cover prior to the first turn, he should do so, however, it was imperative that FOTOGENIC was given the opportunity to be in a forward position.  He said these were the same instructions he received prior to the horse's last start at Happy Valley.  He said on that occasion, despite being vigorously ridden along in the early stages, FOTOGENIC was crossed by another runner shortly after the start which resulted in the horse not being able to be as far forward as intended.  He said in today's race he again rode FOTOGENIC along in the early stages.  He said as MIGHTY GAINS and PRECIOUS GEM were being ridden along in the early stages, it was not available to him to steady FOTOGENIC after the 1100 Metres to take up a trailing position as he was left racing four wide at this time in advance of both those horses.  He said because of this he was required to continue to ride FOTOGENIC along to clear runners to his inside which he was able to do after the 800 Metres.  He said he then attempted to steady FOTOGENIC given the amount of use he had to make of the horse in the early stages.  He added FOTOGENIC travelled keenly in the middle stages and consequently gave ground in the Straight.  He further stated after the race he advised connections to consider riding FOTOGENIC behind the speed in its future races if circumstances permit.  A veterinary inspection of FOTOGENIC immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of NOBLE BUDDIES, J Moreira stated that it had been intended, from the wide barrier, for the horse to be ridden in a forward position if circumstances permitted.  He said after being loaded into the barriers, NOBLE BUDDIES was fractious and as the start was effected began only fairly.  He said for this reason he felt it was in the best interests of the horse to be ridden more conservatively than had been intended rather than ride his mount along to clear runners to the inside.  He said he was able to obtain a trailing position behind PRECIOUS GEM near the 900 Metres, however, NOBLE BUDDIES travelled only fairly in the middle stages.  He added NOBLE BUDDIES came off the bridle prior to the Home Turn and then, despite being ridden along in the early part of the Straight, did not respond to his riding and was disappointing in the manner in which it gave ground.  A veterinary inspection of NOBLE BUDDIES immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of NOBLE BUDDIES, one of the favoured runners in today's race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, NOBLE BUDDIES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Shortly after the start, CRICKET VICI became unbalanced after being bumped by HAPPY FIERY DRAGON.
From the outside barrier, GENTRY was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Near the 900 Metres, MUTUAL JOY was steadied when momentarily racing in restricted room inside MR PICASSO which was then shifted out to relieve the pressure.
Shortly after entering the Straight, GENTRY was shifted out away from the heels of RAPIDASH.
Passing the 250 Metres, GENTRY and HAPPY SOUND raced tight as GENTRY improved into narrow running inside MR PICASSO.
Approaching the 150 Metres, GENTRY, which was closing off well, was shifted out away from the heels of FORMULA GALORE to continue improving and then near the 100 Metres got its head on the side and shifted out marginally, resulting in MR PICASSO, which was giving ground, being inconvenienced.
Throughout the race, HAPPY SOUND travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MR PICASSO, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride the horse positively from barrier 10 in an attempt to obtain a position in advance of midfield.  He said after beginning only fairly, he rode his mount aggressively in the early stages and he had to ride it along for some distance to clear runners to its inside.  He said he was able to obtain a position behind the speed rounding the first turn near the 900 Metres, however, MR PICASSO travelled only fairly and appeared to him not to be appreciating the track surface.  He said MR PICASSO quickened briefly shortly after entering the Straight, however, after the 300 Metres came under pressure and then was disappointing in the manner in which it failed to finish off the race.  He added, in his opinion, the disappointing performance of MR PICASSO could be attributed to the horse's failure to handle the track surface as well as having to be aggressively ridden to cross from barrier 10 in the early stages.  A veterinary inspection of MR PICASSO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on RAPIDASH at the request of Trainer C W Chang.

For the majority of the race, TELECOM BOOM travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that after allowing DASHING FORTUNE to obtain the outright lead and crossing to race on the rail near the 1200 Metres, she attempted to steady the tempo on the horse.  She said DASHING FORTUNE appeared to be travelling comfortably and although she felt the race was being run at a good tempo, she was comfortable at the time to allow the horse to maintain this tempo.  She added in hindsight, after having viewed the video of the race, she should have made more of an effort to steady DASHING FORTUNE given the margin that the horse had developed over the remainder of the field with the exception of ENTITLING.  Apprentice Chiong was advised to ensure that she is mindful of the tempo that she sets on horses so that they are able to finish off the race as best as they are able in the circumstances.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that, from the outside barrier, he had been asked to ride ENTITLING positively in the early stages as the horse had not been performing when ridden from off the speed in its previous three starts in Hong Kong.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode his mount along in the early stages and allowed DASHING FORTUNE, which was racing to the inside of ENTITLING, to take his mount across.  He said after shifting in to race outside DASHING FORTUNE near the 1000 Metres, he was aware that the race was being run at a good tempo, however, given that ENTITLING is a staying type, he was reluctant to steady it as ENTITLING appeared comfortable in its action.  He added he had hoped that by allowing the race to be run at a more genuine tempo would benefit ENTITLING whilst having the horses racing behind his mount coming off the bridle at an early stage.  He said however that this did not eventuate as ENTITLING gave ground from early in the Straight and was most disappointing in the manner in which it gave ground abruptly, irrespective of the tempo in the middle stages.  N Rawiller was also advised to ensure that he rates his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to finish off their race.

When questioned, K C Leung stated that he had been asked to ride LEADING HORSE in a forward position but to allow it to use its natural early speed to assume this position rather than ride it along.  He said as the race was being run over 1800 Metres, it was believed that there was a good opportunity for LEADING HORSE to be able to take up a forward position without having to be made use of which would therefore allow the horse the best opportunity to finish off the race.  He said in the early and middle stages the tempo of the race was strong and he believed that to cross runners to his inside would have required him to ride LEADING HORSE aggressively as was the case with the leader PO CHING TREASURE.  He said, given the tempo of the race, he believed it was in LEADING HORSE's best interests for it not to be pressed forward to obtain a position closer to the rail albeit that this required LEADING HORSE to travel three wide and without cover for the majority of the race.  After having considered the relevant sectionals of the race, the Stewards accepted that it was run at a solid tempo and accordingly no further action was taken.

When questioned, Z Purton, stated that, from barrier 3, he had been asked to have SPEEDY WALLY race in about 5th or 6th position.  He said he had the opportunity passing the winning post on the first occasion to shift in and race on the rail behind ORACLE, however, due to SPEEDY WALLY's racing manners in the past, he decided it was in the best interests of the horse to remain racing away from the rail and because of this decision SPEEDY WALLY then raced in a more forward position than had been intended.  He said after being crossed by MIGHTY WONGCHOY passing the 1200 Metres, SPEEDY WALLY proved very difficult to settle for a considerable distance and got its head up when being checked away from the heels of that horse which resulted in him having to shift SPEEDY WALLY out from behind MIGHTY WONGCHOY near the 900 Metres.  He said rather than raced in a position wide and without cover, he then allowed SPEEDY WALLY to improve to race outside the lead.  He said because of SPEEDY WALLY's racing manners, the horse then was not able to finish off the race.  He added, having regard to the manner in which SPEEDY WALLY weakened in the Straight, he was of the opinion that the horse may be better suited by being ridden more conservatively than it was this evening.  A veterinary inspection of SPEEDY WALLY immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained a small laceration to the right hind leg.

Passing the 200 Metres, DASHING FELLOW was inconvenienced by PACKING LLAREGYB which shifted out.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that she had been asked to have PACKING LLAREGYB begin on terms with the field given that it had been tardy to begin in some of its races.  She said Mr A Schutz, the trainer of PACKING LLAREGYB, instructed her to obtain cover on the horse in the early stages and then to make a mid-race move to allow it to be closer to the speed as it is one-paced and it was felt that the horse would not be able to be competitive if it was giving too much start to horses that have shown a superior turn of foot in their previous races.  She said after receiving these instructions, she was informed by the owner, in the presence of Mr Schutz, that due to PACKING LLAREGYB being one-paced, he would prefer for the horse to be ridden in a more forward position if possible, preferably in 2nd or 3rd position.  Mr Schutz confirmed the initial instructions he gave to Apprentice Chiong and also confirmed the owner's wishes for the horse to be ridden more forward which, given the make-up of the field and with its light weight having employed the services of an apprentice jockey, were in his opinion reasonable.  He said it had initially been his preference for PACKING LLAREGYB to race with cover until prior to the 600 Metres at which point he had anticipated that the horse would commence its forward move.  He added however that having regard to the owner's wishes and given the make-up of today's race, he was satisfied with Apprentice Chiong's riding.  Having regard to the fact that this race was run at a slower than standard tempo in the early stages and the pace of the race did not increase until after the 800 Metres, the Stewards took no further action given the circumstances.  After the race, it was reported by the Veterinary Surgeon that PACKING LLAREGYB had sustained a wound to the left front fetlock.

Passing the 500 Metres, TEAM FORTUNE and NO MONEY NO TALK were crowded for room between WAH MAY FRIEND which raced very wide and ALMABABY which got its head on the side and lay out.  In this incident, WAH MAY FRIEND became unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by NO MONEY NO TALK.
Approaching the 150 Metres, POWER OF ONE, which was closing off the race fairly, shifted in away from the heels of ALMABABY (Y T Cheng) which shifted in under pressure.  Then passing the 150 Metres, POWER OF ONE was checked when disappointed for a run between ALMABABY and GOAL FOR GOLD which shifted out to obtain clear running.  Whilst the Stewards were satisfied that POWER OF ONE had not established running to the inside of ALMABABY, nonetheless Y T Cheng was advised to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground.
When questioned, T H So (NO MONEY NO TALK) stated that he had been instructed to attempt to obtain a midfield position with cover if possible from the outside barrier.  He said after urging his mount along in the initial stages, he shifted NO MONEY NO TALK across behind runners and attempted to obtain a position behind POWER OF ONE which was being ridden along in the early stages.  He said however that NO MONEY NO TALK commenced to prove difficult to settle and he was not able to restrain the horse sufficiently to obtain this trailing position.  He added that as a consequence NO MONEY NO TALK was left racing outside POWER OF ONE after the 1000 Metres and wide.  He said he continued to restrain NO MONEY NO TALK in an endeavour to obtain cover, however, the more he attempted to steady the horse, the more NO MONEY NO TALK commenced to travel keenly and because of this he was obliged to race very wide and without cover after the 900 Metres.  T H So was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he should, wherever possible, attempt to ride his mounts in such a manner so that they do not cover unnecessary ground.
Throughout the race, WAH MAY FRIEND travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on SPEEDY ACHIEVER at the request of Trainer A T Millard.  The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, SPEEDY ACHIEVER will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of WAH MAY FRIEND immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                On arrival at the Start, it was noted that INVENTION MASTER had shifted its left front plate.  INVENTION MASTER was examined by the Veterinary Officer who advised that the horse had punctured the sole of its foot and accordingly was not suitable to race.  Acting on this advice, INVENTION MASTER was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  Before being allowed to race again, INVENTION MASTER will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
FORMULA GALORE, which proved difficult to load, will be required to perform satisfactorily in a stalls test before being permitted to race again.
DANEWIN EXPRESS began only fairly.
Shortly after the start, UNBEATABLE GUTS and RICCO RICCO bumped heavily, resulting in both horses becoming unbalanced.
From the outside barrier, GLACIER BLUE was shifted across behind runners shortly after the start.
In the early stages, FORMULA GALORE got its head up on a number of occasions when being steadied to obtain cover behind the field from a wide barrier.
Passing the 1000 Metres, DANEWIN EXPRESS got its head up when proving difficult to settle and awkwardly placed close to the heels of TRIUMPHANT LIGHT.
Passing the 300 Metres, DANEWIN EXPRESS was steadied when crowded for room between SPICY DOUBLE which shifted out and TRIUMPHANT LIGHT (D Whyte) which, after being held up for clear running, shifted to the inside of SNOW SLIDER to obtain clear running.  D Whyte was severely reprimanded and told that whilst SPICY DOUBLE had only shifted out marginally prior to him committing TRIUMPHANT LIGHT to the inside of SNOW SLIDER, he must ensure that he is properly clear of other runners when shifting ground.
TRIUMPHANT LIGHT was unable to obtain clear running from passing the 400 Metres until near the 250 Metres.

After the race, T H So (UNBEATABLE GUTS) reported that his saddle shifted back in the early stages, placing him at a disadvantage.
When questioned regarding the performance of INVENTOR, Z Purton stated that after having to ride his mount along to obtain a forward position, he was able to obtain a good position just behind the speed.  He said rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight he was held up for clear running behind UNBEATABLE GUTS and it was not until near the 300 Metres that he was able to commence to fully test INVENTOR.  He said after this the horse did not quicken and was disappointing in its failure to finish off the race.  He added whilst INVENTOR did have difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight and consequently lost momentum at a crucial stage of the race, he was of the belief that having to ride INVENTOR along in the early part of the race may have impacted on the horseâs ability to finish off the race.  He said accordingly, he informed the connections that he believed that INVENTOR may be better suited to being ridden more conservatively in the early part of the race than it was today.  A veterinary inspection of INVENTOR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on HAR HAR CHARMING at the request of Trainer T P Yung.  The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horse's trachea.

When questioned, N Callan stated that due to the lack of anticipated pace in this race, he had been asked to try and take advantage of this situation by riding IMPERIAL GALLANTRY in a forward position and lead if possible.  He explained that IMPERIAL GALLANTRY sweated up badly behind the barriers.  He further stated that he had to ride IMPERIAL GALLANTRY along in the early stages as it was initially reluctant to go forward.  He said after crossing to the lead passing the 1400 Metres, IMPERIAL GALLANTRY was inclined to lay away from the inside rail and then in the Straight hung in under pressure and became unbalanced near the 400 Metres after shifting in towards the running rail of its own accord.

At the entrance to the Straight, RIGHT CALL and JOLLY BANNER raced tight as RIGHT CALL shifted out into clear running.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong (GOLDEN DEER) stated that rounding the Home Turn her mount was awkwardly placed close to the heels of DIGITAL GENERATION.  She said shortly after entering the Straight she elected to shift GOLDEN DEER to the outside of DIGITAL GENERATION in an attempt to obtain clear running and was unaware at this time that a run was available to the inside of DIGITAL GENERATION and outside JUBILEE FUN which would have afforded GOLDEN DEER the opportunity to follow TOO FAST through.  She added at the entrance to the Straight GOLDEN DEER was awkwardly placed close to the heels of DIGITAL GENERATION and passing the 250 Metres was shifted out away from the heels of that horse which shifted in under pressure.  She further stated that after attempting to improve into running between DIGITAL GENERATION and SKY KING, passing the 100 Metres she then switched to the outside of SKY KING to obtain clear running.  Apprentice Chiong was advised to ensure that she is aware of advantageous runs which develop in races so as to ensure that horses are afforded clear running at the earliest opportunity.
After the race Y T Cheng was dislodged from GLENEALY PRIZE without incident after that horse shifted abruptly.
Following the race, J Moreira was unable to offer any excuse for the disappointing performance of RIGHT CALL.  He said he was able to obtain a good run throughout the race behind the leader YOUNG DREAMER, however, rounding the Home Turn when he shifted RIGHT CALL out to obtain clear running, the horse did not quicken as he thought it would and he was unable to prevent JOLLY BANNER from establishing a margin over RIGHT CALL.

GOLD TARTINI began only fairly.
Near the 1700 Metres, GOOD FIT was awkwardly placed close to the heels of MI SAVVY BOY when momentarily crowded for room between that horse and LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, both of which shifted ground.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, MI SAVVY BOY was steadied to avoid the heels of GLAMOROUS RYDER (Apprentice K K Chiong) which shifted in when not properly clear.

When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been instructed that if COOL PAL began well, he should allow the horse to use its natural speed and obtain a forward position, however, not to ride the horse along to go forward.  He said he was further instructed that if COOL PAL began only fairly, he should attempt to obtain a position in midfield with cover.  He said COOL PAL was fractious in the barriers and began awkwardly and for this reason he felt that to obtain a forward position would have required COOL PAL to be ridden along, therefore he steadied the horse shortly after the start and attempted to obtain a position with cover.  He added when being steadied in order to be shifted in, COOL PAL proved difficult to settle and due to the make-up of the field, in the run to the first turn he was not able to obtain a midfield position and had to steady COOL PAL towards the rear of the field to find cover.  He said during this time COOL PAL continued to prove difficult to settle until about the 1300 Metres.  Trainer A Lee confirmed that he had instructed M L Yeung to go forward on COOL PAL if the horse began well, however, as COOL PAL had run well previously after missing the start, he did not want it to be ridden aggressively to go forward and therefore he had asked Jockey Yeung to obtain cover in the early stages and if the opportunity presented itself, to make a mid-race move which the horse had also done successfully in the past.  He expressed the opinion that M L Yeung could have provided COOL PAL with a better opportunity to go forward in the early stages rather than seeking to obtain cover shortly after the start.  M L Yeung was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have made a far greater effort than he did on this occasion to allow COOL PAL the opportunity to obtain a forward position in the early stages.  He was also told that he would be expected in future to make appropriate endeavour to comply with his instructions.

Apprentice K K Chiong (SPARKLING SWORD) advised that it had been intended for the horse to be ridden in a forward position.  She said SPARKLING SWORD was standing well in the barriers until the hood was removed at which time the horse became fractious and as the start was effected sat back, resulting in it being slow to begin.  She said as there were a considerable number of horses in advance of SPARKLING SWORD which was racing to the inside of GRIFFINDOR, it was not available for her to recover lost ground and consequently SPARKLING SWORD was obliged to race back in the field.  A veterinary inspection of SPARKLING SWORD immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that after being left racing wide and without cover near the 1200 Metres, he considered allowing APACHE SPIRIT to improve its position near the 1100 Metres.

He said at this time he felt that LAUGHING LORD would shift out to a three wide positon due to the manner in which it was travelling which would allow APACHE SPIRIT the opportunity to obtain cover behind that horse and therefore he elected not to allow APACHE SPIRIT to stride forward.  He said however that LAUGHING LORD was able to shift back in behind MASSIVE POWER near the 1000 Metres which left his mount again racing three wide and without cover.  He added at this time the tempo commenced to increase and he felt that the opportunity to go forward had passed and therefore he elected to keep APACHE SPIRIT balanced albeit that the horse was required to continue racing wide and without cover.

GRAND HARBOUR travelled wide and without cover until the 900 Metres.
Passing the 600 Metres, GONNA RUN and SUPEROI raced tight as GONNA RUN shifted away from the rail.  GONNA RUN then raced tight between FOODIE and SUPEROI for a short distance after this.
Approaching the 500 Metres, HEROIC GURU was steadied away from the heels of TRENDY WIN.
Rounding the Home Turn, GONNA RUN again raced in restricted room between FOODIE and SUPEROI.  HEROIC GURU was checked away from the heels of GONNA RUN in consequence.
SUPEROI had some difficulty obtaining clear running approaching the 200 Metres.
When questioned, C Y Ho stated that he had been asked to lead on HAPPY SPIRIT as the horse had previously raced best when ridden in this manner.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode HAPPY SPIRIT vigorously in the early stages to take up a forward position, however, HAPPY SPIRIT did not show as much early speed as anticipated with CLASSIC EMPEROR and GOLDEN SLEEP obtaining prominent positions.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion, after being crossed by CLASSIC EMPEROR which shifted in to race outside the leader GOLDEN SLEEP, he remained racing in a three wide position as he was aware that HAPPY SURVEYS was racing inside the heels of HAPPY SPIRIT.  He said HAPPY SPIRIT was also racing tight inside GRAND HARBOUR which was improving its position to the outside of HAPPY SPIRIT.  He said at this time he was receiving calls from the rider of HAPPY SURVEYS and as he was of the opinion that he was not properly clear of that horse, he was required then to remain racing in a three wide position.  He added he had also hoped that CLASSIC EMPEROR, after shifting in to race outside the lead, would be steadied and the tempo of the race would slow as occurs on occasions in races run at Happy Valley.  He said by remaining in a three wide position, he believed that this would provide HAPPY SPIRIT with the opportunity to continue on into the lead were the tempo of the race to steady.  He said however that he was unable to prevent GRAND HARBOUR from shifting in in advance of HAPPY SPIRIT during which time HAPPY SURVEYS was able to consolidate its position inside HAPPY SPIRIT.  He further stated that when GRAND HARBOUR improved forward of CLASSIC EMPEROR after the 900 Metres, HAPPY SPIRIT was then left racing wide and without cover.  C Y Ho was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he must, wherever circumstances permit, ride his mounts in such a manner so as to avoid covering unnecessary ground.
When questioned regarding his riding of REGENCY KING, Y T Cheng stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on the horse, however, it was explained to him that REGENCY KING had been slow to begin on a number of occasions.  He said after the blindfold was removed from REGENCY KING just prior to the start being effected, GRAND HARBOUR, which was in the adjoining stall, became fractious which resulted in REGENCY KING also becoming fractious, getting its head up on jumping and beginning very awkwardly.  He said because of this REGENCY KING lost ground at the start.  He said he immediately commenced to ride REGENCY KING along in an endeavour to make up lost ground, however, the horse was reluctant to stretch out in the early stages despite his riding.  He added rounding the Home Turn REGENCY KING was taken wider by HEROIC GURU when that horse shifted out abruptly away from the heels of GONNA RUN.  He said he commenced to ride his mount along in the early part of the Straight and REGENCY KING shifted in which resulted in it becoming very awkwardly placed close to the heels of HAPPY SPIRIT approaching the 200 Metres when disappointed for running inside that horse and to the outside of HEROIC GURU which shifted out to obtain clear running.  He further stated that when being shifted out across the heels of HAPPY SPIRIT, REGENCY KING then got its head up and overreacted badly.  He said after obtaining clear running after the 200 Metres, he rode his mount out and REGENCY KING finished off the race strongly.  Whilst acknowledging that REGENCY KING had previously been awkward in its races, particularly at the start, Y T Cheng was advised that his riding of the horse in the early part of the Straight had come under notice and he must, wherever circumstances permit, ensure that his horses are afforded clear running.  Having considered the manner in which REGENCY KING began and how it reacted when being shifted out across the heels of HAPPY SPIRIT in the Straight, the Stewards deemed the racing manners of REGENCY KING to be unacceptable and as a consequence the horse will be required to barrier trial satisfactorily around a bend prior to its next race start. 
After the race, B Prebble advised that in accordance with his instructions, he rode CLASSIC EMPEROR positively in the early stages to take up a forward position.  He said however that CLASSIC EMPEROR then refused to settle and travelled keenly throughout the early and middle stages and as a consequence was not able to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of CLASSIC EMPEROR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of AMAZING FEELING, K C Leung stated that he had been asked to obtain a position behind the speed in the early stages to take advantage of the horse's inside barrier.  He said he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, AMAZING FEELING did not show sufficient speed to prevent GENEROUS BOBO to cross his mount approaching the 1100 Metres and this resulted in AMAZING FEELING racing further back in the field than had been intended.  He added making the first turn near the 1000 Metres AMAZING FEELING was awkwardly placed close to the heels of RAINBOW FIGHTER, however, after this, continued to travel well.

Throughout the race, WINNING LEADER, DOYENI and SERGEANT TITANIUM travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, C Schofield stated that when ridden from behind at its last start, CONSORT had raced keenly.  He said as the horse had shown good speed in a recent trial and had raced on the speed prior to being imported into Hong Kong, it was decided for the horse to be ridden in a forward position but not necessarily to lead.  He said after beginning fairly he initially rode CONSORT along, however, the horse was then able to improve into a forward position without any further pressure.  He said he had hoped to obtain a trailing position behind the leaders, however, when unable to do so, he allowed CONSORT to continue into the lead after the 1400 Metres.  He said CONSORT did not settle at any stage after this and travelled too keenly and consequently was not able to close off the race.  He added, in his opinion, CONSORT handled the track conditions today and the horse's disappointing run could be attributed to the manner in which it travelled in the early and middle stages.  A veterinary inspection of CONSORT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
After the race, M Chadwick stated that after beginning well DOYENI did not show early speed as was anticipated despite being niggled along.

When questioned, J Moreira (DIEGO KOSTA) stated that in the early stages he was left racing wide and without cover and for some distance after the 1000 Metres looked to his inside to establish whether it was available to shift in behind MULTIMAX and obtain a position with cover.  He said at this time he noted YOUNG EMPIRE was occupying that position and therefore it was not available for him to shift in.  He said after the 800 Metres, due to the conditions that the race was being run in, he was not able to properly establish whether YOUNG EMPIRE was continuing to maintain its position to his inside and as such he was not aware that that horse had given ground when unable to maintain its positon.  He added nonetheless DIEGO KOSTA travelled comfortably in the middle stages due to being able to keep the horse balanced in the conditions.

When questioned regarding his riding of ELECTRONIC PHOENIX in the Straight, Z Purton stated that when he rode the horse to run 4th on 31 January this year, he rode it vigorously in the Straight and, in his opinion, ELECTRONIC PHOENIX, after appearing as though it was going to win the race, did not finish off as he expected which gave him the impression that it may not have responded well to being ridden with the whip.  He added in today's race ELECTRONIC PHOENIX quickened very well after the 400 Metres to make up a considerable amount of ground and, given the manner in which it was finishing off the race, he elected not to use the whip on the horse but rode it out vigorously hands and heels in the hope that it would finish off the race in a more genuine manner than had previously when ridden by him.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of VOLITATION, J Moreira stated that his mount travelled well in the early and middle stages, however, as soon as he placed the horse under pressure in the early part of the Straight VOLITATION immediately came under pressure.  He said VOLITATION became unbalanced and did not show the same turn of foot that it did at its last start when successful.

When questioned regarding his riding of FRESH AND FRESH after the 900 Metres, M Chadwick stated that he had been instructed to take up a forward position on FRESH AND FRESH in the early stages and, if possible, to sit outside the anticipated leader CHOICE EXCHEQUER.  He said he was also asked to increase the tempo from about the 800 Metres as FRESH AND FRESH is one-paced and it was thought that the horse may be able to establish something of a margin over the field at this stage of the race.  He said in the early stages he was able to position FRESH AND FRESH outside CHOICE EXCHEQUER and remained racing in that position until after the 900 Metres.  He said at this time he commenced to increase the tempo to establish whether it was available to him to advance clear of CHOICE EXCHEQUER.  He added however that after the 800 Metres CHOICE EXCHEQUER continued forward with FRESH AND FRESH and after the 700 Metres he determined that it was not available to him to assume the outright lead and as he was aware that the race was being run at a quicker than normal tempo, he attempted to steady FRESH AND FRESH as he did not want it to come off the bridle and be challenged by other horses.  Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of FRESH AND FRESH, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Chadwick.  He said as FRESH AND FRESH was backing up after racing over 1800 Metres last week and as it is one-paced, he felt that its fitness would assist the horse if it were able to obtain the lead along the Back Straight and establish a margin over the rest of the field.
A veterinary inspection of CHOICE EXCHEQUER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Passing the 400 Metres, SEA WARRIOR was steadied when awkwardly placed close to the heels of HASTA LA VISTA.
When questioned, Y T Cheng stated that he had been instructed to ride DRAGON HARMONY in a forward position and it was hoped that it would take a trailing position behind the leaders from the inside barrier.  He said on jumping DRAGON HARMONY was checked when crowded for room between EXCELLENT FORTUNE and LUCKY PROFIT which shifted out.  He said this resulted in DRAGON HARMONY racing further back in the field than had been hoped.  He said along the Back Straight whilst there was room ahead of DRAGON HARMONY to improve to be racing closer to SEA WARRIOR, the pace of the race, particularly after the 800 Metres, was quite strong and he believed he would have had to ride DRAGON HARMONY along at this time to make up this ground.  He said approaching the 700 Metres DRAGON HARMONY was racing tight inside MR KOOL which was racing tight inside MIGHTY EQUUS and because of this he was not immediately able to commence to improve his position.  He added after making the turn at the 600 Metres he commenced to ride his mount along to be closer to SEA WARRIOR, however, after the 400 Metres raced in restricted room inside MIGHTY EQUUS.  He said he balanced up DRAGON HARMONY shortly after entering the Straight and commenced to ride the horse along after the 300 Metres before riding it more vigorously approaching the 200 Metres.  Y T Cheng was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, he should have made a greater effort to be closer to SEA WARRIOR in the middle stages and that there was an opportunity to place DRAGON HARMONY under greater pressure earlier than he did in the Straight.  He was further advised that this matter would be added to his disciplinary record.

When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong (SPICY SIAM) stated that she shifted her mount out at the entrance to the Back Straight in expectation of the tempo slackening and felt that SPICY SIAM was travelling well enough to be able to make a forward mid-race move.  She said after shifting to the outside of SWEET BEAN, SPICY SIAM was then reluctant to improve its position and for this reason she was not able to make ground.

N Callan, the rider of the 4th placed, DANEWIN EXPRESS, was questioned regarding his riding out of the horse over the concluding stages.  N Callan stated that as he was riding the horse with the whip in the left hand and as he was aware that AMBITIOUS SPEEDY was to his inside, he put his whip down and exerted pressure on the left rein to ensure that DANEWIN EXPRESS did not continue to shift in and cause interference to AMBITIOUS SPEEDY.  N Callan was advised that having regard to the fact that DANEWIN EXPRESS did shift in inside the final 50 Metres, obliging him to stop riding and that he still had pressure on the left rein, he was being afforded the benefit of the doubt in regard to his failure to ride DANEWIN EXPRESS out over the concluding stages.  Nonetheless he was advised to ensure that, wherever circumstances permit, he should ride his mounts out all the way to the end of the race.

Throughout the race, CAREFREE LET GO, NAMJONG INVINCIBLE, XINJIANG YARN and HAYHAY all travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that he had been asked to ride SMILING GLORY in a forward position from the horse's wide draw.  He said however that SMILING GLORY began awkwardly and then became unbalanced shortly after the start when checked away from the heels of XINJIANG YARN which shifted out.  He said this resulted in SMILING GLORY losing further ground and consequently he elected to shift the horse across behind runners in the early stages rather than attempt to take up a forward position as he believed that SMILING GLORY would have had to do too much work to achieve this.  He added SMILING GLORY travelled keenly in the early and middle stages and passing the 900 Metres was checked away from the heels of SOCKET KING.  He said after this SMILING GLORY became awkward in its action and he was not able to balance the horse back up for the remainder of the race.  He said he shifted SMILING GLORY towards the outside in the Straight in the hope that it would be able to close off, however, SMILING GLORY did not quicken and finished off the race only one-paced.

Rounding the Home Turn, AMAZING KIDS was awkwardly placed close to the heels of MONGOLIAN SATURDAY when being positioned to take a tight run to the inside of that horse.
SUPER JOCKEY had some difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight and shifted in when awkwardly placed close to the heels of AEROVELOCITY passing the 400 Metres, resulting in MONGOLIAN SATURDAY being crowded for room.
Approaching the 300 Metres, BUFFERING, which was commencing to give ground, was momentarily crowded for room inside PENIAPHOBIA which got its head on the side and shifted in after being bumped by AEROVELOCITY.  BUFFERING then commenced to give ground abruptly, resulting in AMAZING KIDS (N Rawiller), which was following that horse, being checked and in turn shifting out away from the heels of BUFFERING, causing MONGOLIAN SATURDAY to be checked when crowded to the inside of SUPER JOCKEY.  The Stewards were satisfied that at no stage did N Rawiller attempt to ride to the outside of BUFFERING and accepted that his mount was being severely checked away from the heels of BUFFERING as it gave ground.  Despite the interference to MONGOLIAN SATURDAY being quite significant, the Stewards formed the view that it was not due to rider error and accordingly no further action was taken.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of THEWIZARDOFOZ, J Moreira stated that after beginning only fairly and then being bumped shortly after the start by DIVINE BOY which was taken in by STRATHMORE, he had to ride the horse continuously in the run to the first turn as it was not stretching out comfortably.  He said had he not have ridden the horse at this time, he was concerned that THEWIZARDOFOZ would lose more ground.  He said THEWIZARDOFOZ did not travel well at any stage of the race and after being placed under pressure well prior to the Home Turn, the horse finished off the race only fairly.

He said when MR VANILLA improved to the outside of LUCKY BALL after the 800 Metres he had hoped that that horse would continue forward which would provide him with the opportunity to follow that horse into the race as the slow sectionals were not to LUCKY BALLâs advantage.  He said however that MR VANILLA did not continue forward which resulted in LUCKY BALL being positioned inside that horse until after straightening.  He added at the entrance to the Straight he immediately shifted LUCKY BALL to the outside of runners in the hope that it would close off the race, however, as LUCKY BALL is one-paced and due to the slow early sectionals, the horse did not quicken sufficiently for it to threaten in the Straight.

When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong (OSCAR MIRACLE) stated that, despite being vigorously ridden along in the early stages, OSCAR MIRACLE failed to show early speed.  She said she continued to press OSCAR MIRACLE until after passing the winning post on the first occasion at which point when the horse was left racing very wide, she shifted it in behind runners.  She said, despite being ridden along throughout the middle stages, OSCAR MIRACLE gave ground and became detached from the field along the Back Straight.  She added, despite this, she continued to ride the horse along, however, OSCAR MIRACLE did not respond to her riding at any stage and consequently finished a significant distance from the main body of the field.  She said during and after the race OSCAR MIRACLE appeared sound in its action and she was not able to offer any explanation for the horseâs disappointing performance.  Mr P F Yiu, the trainer of OSCAR MIRACLE, was unable to offer any explanation for the horseâs disappointing performance.  He said he had hoped that the horse would be able to be ridden in a customary forward position, however, it clearly did not travel well at any stage of the race.  He said OSCAR MIRACLEâs training programme had remained normal and the horse had pleased him in the lead up to tonightâs race.  A veterinary inspection of OSCAR MIRACLE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of OSCAR MIRACLE was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, OSCAR MIRACLE will be required to perform competitively in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the performance of STAR OF BOND, Z Purton stated that it had been intended for the horse to be ridden in the lead as it had raced well at its last start when ridden in that manner.  He said in the early stages he rode his mount along aggressively including slapping it down the shoulder with the whip on a number of occasions as the horse was reluctant to show early speed.  He said after shifting across to race outside the leader SPARKLING SWORD after passing the winning post on the first occasion, his mount was inclined to lay out and, in his opinion, was not racing truly.  He added he did consider riding his mount along approaching the 1200 Metres to prevent WIN IT from crossing STAR OF BOND, however, given the manner in which he had had to ride the horse along in the early stages, he did not believe it would be in the best interests of STAR OF BOND to continue to press forward and therefore elected to allow WIN IT to cross STAR OF BOND after the 1200 Metres to see whether STAR OF BOND would race more genuinely.  He said however after being crossed by WIN IT, STAR OF BOND refused to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions.  He said after entering the Back Straight the pace of the race increased slightly and STAR OF BOND raced more genuinely, however, was still inclined to travel keenly.  He said STAR OF BOND came under pressure to maintain its position near the 550 Metres and he had to ride the horse along from this point onwards in an endeavour to maintain its position.  He further stated that after being steadied away from the heels of GREAT TOPLIGHT approaching the 400 Metres when he was unable to prevent that horse from shifting out, STAR OF BOND commenced to give ground.  He said although STAR OF BOND was momentarily awkwardly placed close to the heels of SUPER SPRINTER passing the 200 Metres, STAR OF BOND was a beaten horse at this time and gave ground noticeably after this.

When questioned regarding the performance of GOT FLY, J Moreira stated that after obtaining a position in about midfield, his mount was unable to quicken when the pace increased after the 500 Metres.  He said whilst GOT FLY was disappointing when unable to improve its position to prevent KING GENKI from shifting out in the Straight, nonetheless he believed that the manner in which the race was run which resulted in the leaders being advantaged provided a legitimate reason for the horse being beaten as, in his opinion, GOT FLY finished off the race only fairly.

After the race, K C Leung stated that FORTUNE BO BO continued to hang in for the remainder of the race after this incident.
VICTORY DAY lost its right front plate at the 450 Metres.
When questioned, B Prebble (HARBOUR ALERT) stated that in pre-race discussions with Mr P OâSullivan, it was agreed that there was good pace in the race with BUDDY BUNDY being drawn an inside barrier and DIAMOND MASTER being drawn outside.  He said it was therefore felt that there was an opportunity for HARBOUR ALERT to obtain the position one out and one back following DIAMOND MASTER which would allow the horse the opportunity to finish off its race.  He said it was felt that in a number of its previous starts the horse had failed to finish off the race after leading and the composition of tonightâs field provided HARBOUR ALERT with the opportunity to obtain a position with cover behind the leaders.  He added, as anticipated, HARBOUR ALERT was able to obtain a position one horse off the rail outside MR RIGHT following DIAMOND MASTER.  He added after initially commencing to finish off the race only fairly in the early part of the Straight, HARBOUR ALERT responded well to his riding and then closed off solidly.  Mr OâSullivan confirmed that it was intended for HARBOUR ALERT to be ridden behind the likely leaders, namely BUDDY BUNDY and DIAMOND MASTER and that he was pleased with the manner in which the horse finished off the race when ridden in this manner.
When questioned, K C Leung stated that as there were a number of horses engaged in the race which were drawn more favourably than FORTUNE BO BO and which had shown good speed in their previous races, it was felt that were FORTUNE BO BO to be ridden along from the outside barrier, that horse would be left racing wide.  He said he was therefore asked to shift the horse across behind runners and obtain a position with cover if possible.

After being ridden along vigorously to improve its position, PIKACHU was steadied near the 1400 Metres when crowded for room inside TURF SPRINT which was racing tight inside DASHING KING which, when being steadied to allow INVINCIBLE DRAGON (N Callan) to cross, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse which was being steadied.  As there were a number of circumstances associated with this incident, no further action was taken, however, N Callan was advised to ensure that he is properly clear of runners to his inside when shifting ground.
After the 1200 Metres, LITTLE DRAGON was left racing wide and without cover.
Passing the 1000 Metres, WINNING LEADER got its head up on a number of occasions when proving difficult to settle.
When the tempo of the race slackened near the 900 Metres, DASHING KING and TURF SPRINT commenced to prove very difficult to settle when awkwardly placed close to the heels of runners in front.  PIKACHU, which was following TURF SPRINT, was checked away from the heels of that horse in consequence.
Passing the 900 Metres, SUPEROI shifted out away from the heels of CARTOON FAY FAY, resulting in SUPEROI racing wide and without cover for the remainder of the race.  CARTOON FAY FAY was also left racing wide and without cover near the 800 Metres.
Rounding the Home Turn, PIKACHU was checked away from the heels of APPROVE which was commencing to give ground.

Approaching the 200 Metres, CARTOON FAY FAY, which was giving ground, momentarily raced in restricted room between GONNA RUN and SUPEROI.
Near the 150 Metres, FANTASTIC KAKA momentarily raced in restricted room inside ISHVARA.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of INVINCIBLE DRAGON, N Callan stated that his mount, which was having its first start at Happy Valley and had not trialed here previously, became quite worked up prior to the start and then proved difficult to load.  He said he was able to obtain a trailing position on INVINCIBLE DRAGON after the 1400 Metres and the horse then travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages.  He said when the tempo of the race slackened on entering the Back Straight, he shifted INVINCIBLE DRAGON out into a three wide position to be following initially LITTLE DRAGON and then CARTOON FAY FAY after the 800 Metres. He added he placed INVINCIBLE DRAGON under pressure prior to the Home Turn, however, the horse finished off the race only fairly.  He said, in his opinion, the horseâs performance tonight was attributable to the fact that it was stepping up from 1200 Metres to 1650 Metres and was competing at Happy Valley for the first occasion.  A veterinary inspection of INVINCIBLE DRAGON immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the performance of TURF SPRINT, N Rawiller stated that the horse, which was having its first start over 1650 Metres tonight, blundered badly at the start.  He said TURF SPRINT then proved very difficult to settle in the early stages, but particularly in the middle stages when the tempo of the race slackened.  He said after becoming badly unbalanced at the top of the Straight due to contact with PIKACHU, he eased the horse down as TURF SPRINT had run its race at that time.  He added whilst the horse was disappointing, it was not able to see out the distance of the race given the manner in which it travelled.  He said because of this he recommended to connections that they consider dropping the horse back in distance in its future races.

Near the 150 Metres, LUCKY GUY was then steadied away from the heels of RED DANCER (M L Yeung) which shifted out when placed under full pressure.  M L Yeung was severely reprimanded and advised that whilst the initial movement from ATHENA BABY and LEADING HORSE had some influence on the incident, he should have resisted pulling the whip until he had properly cleared LUCKY GUY.
WINNAM was held up for clear running for a short distance passing the 200 Metres.
Over the concluding stages, LEADING HORSE shifted out under pressure and brushed RED DANCER.
When questioned, Y T Cheng stated that as GLENEALY PRIZE was stepping up to 1600 Metres for the first time and due to the horseâs outside barrier, he was instructed to take the horse back at the start and find cover.  He said after being steadied to the rear of the field, GLENEALY PRIZE immediately dropped the bit and then refused to stretch out at any stage despite his urging.  He added he did not test the horse over the latter stages as it was out of contention and he feared that there may have been something amiss with GLENEALY PRIZE.  A veterinary inspection of GLENEALY PRIZE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned, Z Purton stated that, from an outside barrier, he had been asked not to bustle CLASSIC EMPEROR in the early stages but to allow the horse to settle where it was comfortable, anticipating that this would be near midfield. He said near the 1300 Metres he shifted in to obtain cover behind ATHENA BABY, however, when that horse subsequently shifted in to a two wide position, CLASSIC EMPEROR was left racing wide and without cover.

He added ARIZONA BLIZZARD continued to hang out throughout the middle stages and then compounded badly in the Straight.  He further stated that, in his view, ARIZONA BLIZZARD's poor performance could be attributed to its inexperience and its fractious nature before the race.  A veterinary inspection of ARIZONA BLIZZARD immediately following the race revealed the horse to be displaying post-race distress.  The performance of ARIZONA BLIZZARD was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, ARIZONA BLIZZARD will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along vigorously in the early stages, however, PO CHING TREASURE did not show the same early speed that it had done at its previous starts when ridden by him.  He said he rode the horse along for a considerable distance including slapping it down the shoulder with the whip, however, PO CHING TREASURE did not show the same early speed as runners drawn more favourably and consequently after travelling approximately 200 Metres, he elected to obtain cover on PO CHING TREASURE rather than continue to ride the horse along.  He added by making this decision he believed it would provide PO CHING TREASURE with more opportunity to finish off the race than the horse would have had were it to be continually ridden along to obtain a forward position.  He said PO CHING TREASURE travelled fairly when racing with cover behind LITTLE ISLAND, but was then left racing wide and without cover after the 900 Metres when LITTLE ISLAND improved its position. 
When questioned regarding the performance of JOLLY GENE, M Chadwick stated that dropping back in distance he was asked to try and have the horse slightly more handy in the run than it was last start, particularly given that it had drawn the inside barrier.

C K Tong was severely reprimanded and advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that RACING HERO had shifted out away from RENAISSANCE ART, nonetheless in similar circumstances he would be expected to make more endeavour to prevent his mounts form shifting ground than he did on this occasion.
Passing the 200 Metres, ANTICIPATION was held up for clear running.
After the race, Apprentice H N Wong stated that after improving into the lead, WINNING LEADER proved difficult to settle, resulting in the horse running at a fast tempo.  He said, despite his efforts, he was unable to have the horse relax in order to steady the pace.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MCQUEEN, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that, in her opinion, the fast tempo of the race did not suit the horse as it was always under pressure chasing the speed.  She said after being left racing three wide and without cover throughout the race MCQUEEN shifted out under pressure rounding the Home Turn.  She added whilst MCQUEEN gave ground in the Straight, she was of the view that the circumstances of the race did not suit the horse.  A veterinary inspection of MCQUEEN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HAPPILABABY, Z Purton stated that the horse should have been suited by the fast tempo, however, HAPPILABABY raced with its head on the side and lay in throughout the race and was not comfortable in its action.  He said having ridden the horse previously, he is of the opinion that HAPPILABABY is best suited to a firmer surface than todayâs track.  He said whilst todayâs track was rated âGoodâ, it did have some give in it due to the rain this morning and this may have accounted for the horseâs disappointing performance.  Mr C S Shum, the trainer of HAPPILABABY, stated that, in his opinion, the horse was not suited by the fast tempo of the race as it was not provided with the opportunity to race on the bridle at any stage.  A veterinary inspection of HAPPILABABY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HAPPILABABY, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.

When questioned, B Prebble (SERGEANT TITANIUM) stated that it was anticipated that todayâs race would be run at a good tempo and therefore he was asked to ride the horse where it was comfortable and it was felt that this would be in about midfield.  He said as SERGEANT TITANIUM had on occasions proved difficult to settle in its races, he was asked not to ride the horse along in the early stages, however, it was felt that the horseâs early speed would allow it to obtain this position without having to be pressed.  He said whilst the tempo of the race in the early stages was quicker than he expected, nonetheless SERGEANT TITANIUM did not show the same early speed that it had done in its previous races when ridden by him and as such he would have had to ride his mount along in order to obtain a midfield position as instructed.  He added he therefore allowed SERGEANT TITANIUM to remain racing where it was comfortable which resulted in the horse being further back in the field than had been intended.  He said SERGEANT TITANIUM travelled fairly in the middle stages and in the early part of the Straight was gaining momentum and gave him the impression that it was going to finish off the race.  He said however that after being checked near the 350 Metres SERGEANT TITANIUM lost momentum and therefore he eased it down after this point.  A veterinary inspection of SERGEANT TITANIUM immediately following the race revealed the horse to be lame in its right front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, SERGEANT TITANIUM will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After the race, T H So (BERLINI) was unable to offer any excuse for the disappointing performance of the horse which gave ground abruptly in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of BERLINI immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of BERLINI, which had been successful in its two most recent starts, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BERLINI will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

O Doleuze (HAPPY FIERY DRAGON) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that at about the 1350 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of ANIMATION MASTER, causing that horse to be checked and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  When ANIMATION MASTER was checked, FAST AND FURIOUS, which was following, was hampered and shifted in away from the heels of that horse in consequence.  O Doleuze was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 2 June 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Sunday, 22 May 2016.

Passing the 250 Metres, ANIMATION MASTER was disappointed for running between CLEVER SPIRIT and VICTORY MASTER which shifted out.  After being directed to the inside of VICTORY MASTER approaching the 200 Metres, ANIMATION MASTER was steadied after the 150 Metres when again disappointed for running between HAPPY FIERY DRAGON which was giving ground and VICTORY MASTER which shifted in.  ANIMATION MASTER was then awkwardly placed behind VICTORY MASTER until the concluding stages and as a consequence was not able to be properly tested.
Near the 150 Metres, SPICY DOUBLE was steadied away from the heels of ANIMATION MASTER.

Near the 850 Metres, BRILLIANT DREAM got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of MR BOGART which was being ridden along when reluctant to maintain its position inside YOUNG EMPIRE.
Near the 650 Metres, MR BOGART became badly unbalanced when racing tight inside YOUNG EMPIRE which was racing tight inside SUN TOUCH (Z Purton) which shifted in marginally.  GLORIOUS AVENUE and BRILLIANT DREAM, which were following, were inconvenienced in consequence.  Z Purton was advised that whilst the amount of ground that SUN TOUCH shifted at this stage was not great, nonetheless he must ensure that he leaves sufficient racing room for runners to his inside in future.
In the early part of the Straight, DIEGO KOSTA raced in restricted room when improving into tight running between BORNTOACHIEVE and BLAZE STAMINA.
Also in the early part of the Straight, MR BOGART had some difficulty obtaining clear running.

                EASY TOUCH was withdrawn on 13.5.16 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (lame left front foot) and was replaced by Standby Declared Starter DRAGON GENERAL (O Bosson).  Before being allowed to race again, EASY TOUCH will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
On arrival at the Start, it was noted that DRAGON GENERAL had lost its left front plate.  After this plate was refitted, DRAGON GENERAL was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.  This resulted in a delay to the start of the race.
BAD BOY lifted its front feet off the ground as the start was effected and then was bumped by DIAMOND DRAGON which began awkwardly and shifted out.  A short distance after the start, DIAMOND DRAGON, which continued to shift out, was checked away from the heels of SPEEDY ACHIEVER which shifted in, resulting in DIAMOND DRAGON losing ground.
OUR FOLKS, which was fractious in the barriers, was crowded for room on jumping between IMPERIAL FIGHTER and SMART DECLARATION, both of which shifted ground.  A short distance after the start, IMPERIAL FIGHTER was steadied away from the heels of DRAGON GENERAL which shifted out.
DRAGON GENERAL lost its right front plate at the 700 Metres and its left front plate over the concluding stages.
After the 400 Metres, RACING SUPERNOVA (Z Purton) was shifted to the inside of the heels of WINFULL PATROL so as to be positioned to improve between WINFULL PATROL and PERPETUAL TREASURE.  A short distance later, DRAGON GENERAL (O Bosson) shifted out marginally and brushed PERPETUAL TREASURE which then shifted out away from that horse and bumped RACING SUPERNOVA, causing both horses to become unbalanced.  RACING SUPERNOVA then improved sharply to be close to the heels of WINFULL PATROL and was checked away from the heels of that horse and shifted in marginally, making further contact with PERPETUAL TREASURE which, when already unbalanced, became further unbalanced, shifted in and bumped DRAGON GENERAL.  DRAGON GENERAL then became badly unbalanced and lay out badly, causing PERPETUAL TREASURE to be severely checked when buffeted for room between DRAGON GENERAL and RACING SUPERNOVA which continued to be checked away from the heels of WINFULL PATROL.  The Stewards found that Z Purton was fully entitled to initially direct RACING SUPERNOVA towards the inside of the heels of WINFULL PATROL as at no time did that horse have to make contact with PERPETUAL TREASURE in order to do so.  The Stewards were also comfortable that the initial marginal shift outwards from DRAGON GENERAL was as a result of no carelessness on the part of O Bosson.  The Stewards ruled that whilst this incident was one of considerable significance, it was not attributable to any rider error and accordingly no further action was taken.  Z Purton stated that after this he shifted RACING SUPERNOVA to the outside of WINFULL PATROL to relieve the tightening to PERPETUAL TREASURE and also to extricate RACING SUPERNOVA away from the heels of WINFULL PATROL.  He said however at this time there was not sufficient room for RACING SUPERNOVA to improve to the outside of WINFULL PATROL and after PERPETUAL TREASURE lost ground, he felt that there was a brief opportunity where a run may present itself to the inside of WINFULL PATROL and outside DRAGON GENERAL near the 200 Metres.  He said however that run did not materialize due to both horses shifting slight ground and therefore he was forced to check RACING SUPERNOVA near the 150 Metres and direct his mount to the outside of WINFULL PATROL which had shifted in away from the outside rail.  He added he was able to obtain clear running outside WINFULL PATROL near the 100 Metres and RACING SUPERNOVA then finished off the race strongly.
Passing the 300 Metres, OUR FOLKS was shifted to the inside of ARCHIPPUS after being disappointed for running between that horse and SMART DECLARATION.
Passing the 200 Metres, BAD BOY got its head on the side and shifted out away from SPEEDY ACHIEVER, resulting in its rider having to stop riding and straighten.  A short distance after this, BAD BOY and SPEEDY ACHIEVER bumped.
Near the 100 Metres, BAD BOY was bumped by SPEEDY ACHIEVER which shifted out marginally.
Over the concluding stages, SPEEDY ACHIEVER raced tight inside ARCHIPPUS and consequently was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
Close to the finishing line, WINFULL PATROL raced tight outside DRAGON GENERAL.
After the race, it was reported that IMPERIAL FIGHTER had bled from both nostrils.  A subsequent endoscopic examination of that horse conducted by the Veterinary Officer confirmed IMPERIAL FIGHTER to have bled.

Despite being vigorously ridden along in the early stages, both SEMPITERNAL and NORTHERN FALLS failed to muster early speed and consequently raced wide and without cover throughout the race.
After the 1200 Metres, HIT THE BID got its head up when being steadied to obtain cover.
Over the final 100 Metres, SURE PEACE was checked away from the heels of HIT THE BID when badly held up for clear running behind that horse and inside SEMPITERNAL.  When held up for clear running, SURE PEACE shifted away from the heels of HIT THE BID and near the 50 Metres brushed the hindquarters of SEMPITERNAL which became badly unbalanced.  Due to this incident, C K Tong, the rider of SEMPITERNAL, was obliged to stop riding over the concluding stages.
FOODIE lost its left hind plate during the race.
The performance of NORTHERN FALLS, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  A veterinary inspection of NORTHERN FALLS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

ENORMOUS HONOUR shifted out at the start, resulting in POWER OF ONE being bumped and taken out onto SUPER LEADER which also became unbalanced after being bumped.
VICTORY FOLLOW ME was slow to begin and then shortly after the start was shifted across behind runners.
Shortly after the start, RUN FORREST attempted to savage KINGSFIELD.  As this was the second occasion on which RUN FORREST had attempted to savage another runner during a race, Trainer C S Shum was advised that the horse must undergo a series of satisfactory consecutive barrier trials amongst other runners before being allowed to race again.  Mr Shum was further advised that should at any time in the future RUN FORREST attempt to savage another runner, a recommendation would be forwarded to the Clubâs Board of Stewards that the horse be compulsorily retired.
Approaching the 1300 Metres, POWER OF ONE lost ground and SUPER LEADER was hampered when crowded for room between RUN FORREST and ENORMOUS HONOUR, both of which shifted ground.
Passing the 500 Metres, SUPER LEADER and POWER OF ONE bumped as a result of POWER OF ONE being taken out by KINGSFIELD.  SUPER FLUKE, which was following, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of POWER OF ONE in consequence.  SUPER FLUKE then had difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
RAGING BULL also had difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
In the early part of the Straight, KINGSFIELD got its head on the side and shifted out away from SIMPLY INVINCIBLE and in doing so shifted out towards the heels of ENORMOUS HONOUR.  Then near the 350 Metres, KINGSFIELD was checked when ENORMOUS HONOUR (Apprentice K K Chiong) shifted in.  Apprentice Chiong was severely reprimanded and advised that whilst KINGSFIELD had initially shifted out towards ENORMOUS HONOUR, nonetheless she has an obligation to make every endeavour to prevent her mounts from shifting ground under pressure.
Passing the 300 Metres, KINGSFIELD was awkwardly placed outside the heels of SIMPLY INVINCIBLE.
Approaching the 250 Metres, SIMPLY INVINCIBLE raced in restricted room between CLASSIC VINEGAR and ENORMOUS HONOUR, both of which shifted ground.
Passing the 250 Metres, SUPER LEADER was awkwardly placed outside the heels of POWER OF ONE which shifted out.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong (ENORMOUS HONOUR) stated that after the 900 Metres she had a good trailing position behind CLASSIC VINEGAR one horse off the rail.  She said however near the 800 Metres the tempo of the race steadied and ENORMOUS HONOUR commenced to travel keenly and because of this she was obliged to shift her horse out away from the heels of CLASSIC VINEGAR which resulted in ENORMOUS HONOUR racing in a three wide position without cover outside that horse after the 800 Metres.
When questioned, J Moreira (PEOPLEâS KNIGHT) stated that it had been intended for the horse to be ridden in a forward position behind the speed.  He said after being placed in the barriers PEOPLEâS KNIGHT became fractious and after the blindfold was removed from the horse, it lunged at the front gates.  He said then just prior to the start being effected PEOPLEâS KNIGHT again became restless and as the start was effected lifted its front feet off the ground and consequently was slow to begin.  He said he was able to improve his position in the early stages to be following the eventual winner SIMPLY INVINCIBLE just worse than midfield and PEOPLEâS KNIGHT travelled comfortably in the early and middle stages albeit much further back in the field than had been intended.  He added he improved around SIMPLY INVINCIBLE near the 700 Meters and felt that the horse was travelling well enough to finish off the race, however, after being placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn PEOPLEâS KNIGHT was then disappointing in the manner in which it failed to respond to his riding and finished off only one-paced.  A veterinary inspection of PEOPLEâS KNIGHT immediately following the race revealed the horse to have sustained a small cut to the left front fetlock.

                After being loaded into the barriers, SO FAST became fractious and reared, resulting in it getting both front legs into the adjoining stall occupied by MERION for a considerable time.  Both SO FAST and MERION were removed from the barriers and examined by the Veterinary Officer who said SO FAST was not suitable to race.  Acting on this advice, SO FAST was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  Before being allowed to race again, SO FAST will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.  MERION was found to be suitable to race.  After MERION (Z Purton) was examined by the Veterinary Officer and passed suitable to race, a member of the starting gate team assigned the duty of signalling the suitability or otherwise of horses to race mistakenly signalled that MERION was to be withdrawn, due in part to the misbelief that Z Purton was unsaddling the horse when in fact he was only adjusting the saddle.  At no stage was MERION officially notified as being withdrawn and accordingly that horse took its place in the field.  It is the intention of Management to review the circumstances of this incident and make the appropriate recommendations.
GORGEOUS KING was slow to begin.

Throughout the race, AMBER DRAGON travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, K Teetan, the rider of HAMMER KING, stated that he had been instructed to ride the horse in a midfield position with cover from barrier 13 if possible.  He said after riding his mount along in the early stages HAMMER KING then commenced to prove very difficult to settle passing the 1300 Metres and, despite his attempts to restrain the horse, HAMMER KING would not relax and because of this raced further forward than had been intended.  He said after obtaining a position outside the leader BULLISH SMART and inside AMBER DRAGON, HAMMER KING continued to prove difficult to settle and he was not able to restrain his mount sufficiently to allow AMBER DRAGON to cross HAMMER KING to obtain cover.

Throughout the race, BUDDY BUNDY travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, G Lerena stated that after making the turn passing the 600 Metres FANTASTIC FEELING commenced to lay in.  He said he was able to shift FANTASTIC FEELING to the outside of the heels of SKY MAN after the 500 Metres and commenced to improve to the outside of that horse.  He said FANTASTIC FEELING continued to lay in and rounding the Home Turn he had the opportunity to shift to the outside of BUDDY BUNDY, however, having in mind the manner in which FANTASTIC FEELING was laying in and as the run was available between BUDDY BUNDY and SKY MAN, he elected to pursue that run rather than be awkwardly placed outside the heels of BUDDY BUNDY which had travelled wide throughout the race.  He added after improving between BUDDY BUNDY and SKY MAN, FANTASTIC FEELING momentarily had difficulty obtaining clear running between TOP BONUS and SKY MAN approaching the 200 Metres, however, was then able to improve between those runners.  He said he attempted to shift FANTASTIC FEELING to the outside of HARBOUR ALERT, however, FANTASTIC FEELING hung in under pressure and therefore he allowed the horse to shift to the inside of the heels of HARBOUR ALERT to continue improving.  He further stated that over the concluding stages FANTASTIC FEELING continued to hang in and raced tight outside SKY MAN and consequently he was not able to ride the horse out all the way to the end of the race.
When questioned, Z Purton (TRIUMPHANT JEWEL) stated that he was asked to obtain a trailing position from barrier 3 as it was anticipated that HARBOUR ALERT and particularly SKY MAN, which were drawn inside TRIUMPHANT JEWEL, would show superior early speed.  He said after shifting TRIUMPHANT JEWEL across to trail SKY MAN shortly after the start, he immediately had to commence to ride TRIUMPHANT JEWEL along as the horse was not stretching out in the early stages.  He said, despite being vigorously ridden along, TRIUMPHANT JEWEL continued to be reluctant to stride out and dipped on two occasions along the Back Straight.  He added he continued to urge TRIUMPHANT JEWEL along, however, the horse did not show any response and again dipped after the 500 Metres.  He said as he had concerns for TRIUMPHANT JEWEL, he did not ride it out in the Home Straight as the horse was well beaten at this time.  A veterinary inspection of TRIUMPHANT JEWEL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of TRIUMPHANT JEWEL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.

After the 1100 Metres, MONEY MAN got its head on the side, shifted in of its own accord and became unbalanced.
Near the 450 Metres, CHINA DELIGHT broke down and was retired from the event.  A veterinary inspection of CHINA DELIGHT immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained an injury to the left front leg.

After the race, Y T Cheng (LUCKY HAMMER) stated that after AMAZINGLY improved to the outside of his mount near the 1200 Metres, LUCKY HAMMER commenced to travel keenly and consequently he was not able to steady the pace, resulting in the race being run at a faster tempo than he had anticipated.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that she had been instructed by the owner of AMAZINGLY, in the presence of Mr D E Ferraris, the trainer of the horse, to ride it in a forward position due to its outside barrier and also because horses racing up on the speed had appeared to be advantaged in earlier races.  She said after having to make some use of AMAZINGLY in the early stages to cross runners to her inside, AMAZINGLY was able to shift in to race outside the leader LUCKY HAMMER near the 1100 Metres.  She said after obtaining this position she immediately commenced to steady the tempo on AMAZINGLY as she was aware that the race was being run at a fast pace.  She added AMAZINGLY initially took some time to steady, however, she was able to bring the horse back and have it travel more comfortably approaching the 800 Metres.  Apprentice Chiong was advised to ensure that she does all in her power to rate her mounts in such a manner so that they are able to finish off their race.  Mr Ferraris confirmed that the owner had requested for the horse to be ridden in a forward position tonight due to a number of factors including the use of a claiming apprentice, the horseâs outside barrier, the manner in which horses racing on the speed had performed well in earlier races and that there did not appear to be a great amount of speed engaged in tonightâs race.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of NEWSWIRE FREE, J Moreira stated that he had to ride the horse along for some distance in the run to the winning post on the first occasion to obtain a good position.  He said after steadying his mount passing the winning post on the first occasion to allow DANEWIN EXPRESS to cross, NEWSWIRE FREE travelled keenly and then near the 1000 Metres became unbalanced and lay in.  He said after this he was able to have NEWSWIRE FREE balanced and the horse then travelled fairly in the middle stages.  He added NEWSWIRE FREE came under heavy pressure after the 500 Metres and, despite being vigorously ridden along, did not quicken.  He said then in the Straight NEWSWIRE FREE lay in quite badly and proved difficult to ride and after the 100 Metres was shifted out abruptly away from the heels of DANEWIN EXPRESS.  He said whilst NEWSWIRE FREE was inclined to lay in last start when the horse raced well, on that occasion NEWSWIRE FREE travelled on the rail and was not required to go around horses.  He said this was in contrast to tonight where the horse was required to race away from the rail and outside of runners.  Nonetheless he said NEWSWIRE FREE was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding in the Straight.

                Earlier today the Stewards were advised by Dr T S M Wan, the Club's Head of Racing Laboratory, that a pre-race urine sample taken from a horse entered to run in tonight's racemeeting was found to contain the prohibited substance phenylbutazone and its metabolite oxyphenbutazone.

When questioned regarding his riding of MR BOGART, Y T Cheng stated that, from barrier 11, he had been asked to ride the horse along in the early stages and obtain a forward position if possible to overcome the wide barrier.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode MR BOGART vigorously for the first 100 Metres of the race in an endeavour to comply with his instructions, however, a considerable number of horses, which were drawn more favourably than MR BOGART, were also ridden to obtain forward positions and he believed that if he continued to ride the horse along, he would not be able to obtain the position as required and would be left racing extremely wide.  He said for this reason after the 900 Metres he elected to steady MR BOGART and obtain a position behind the leaders with cover.  He said however that when a number of horses drawn towards the inside were also steadied to allow OUR FOLKS and NEW ASIA SUNRISE to cross, this resulted in MR BOGART being left racing wide and without cover after the 800 Metres.  He added passing the 500 Metres he commenced to ride MR BOGART along and in the early part of the Straight rode the horse out hands and heels.  He said after being bumped by JADE FORTUNE inside the 400 Metres, MR BOGART became unbalanced which also resulted in him becoming unbalanced.  He said he then took some time to rebalance MR BOGART and it was not until near the 200 Metres that he was able to commence to fully test the horse.  He said after riding the horse out including using the whip, MR BOGART was finishing off the race only one-paced until near the 100 Metres at which time SECRET COMMAND shifted out to his inside which resulted in him being disappointed for running between that horse and ALL YOU WISH which had improved quickly to the outside of MR BOGART.  He said as a consequence he was not able to ride MR BOGART out fully over the concluding stages.  Y T Cheng was severely reprimanded and advised that his lack of vigour from inside the 400 Metres until approaching the 200 Metres had come under notice.  He was again reminded of a number of times that he had been spoken to regarding his riding of horses this season alone and also informed that this would be brought to the attention of the Licensing Committee at their next meeting.

J Moreira (GOLD TARTINI) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 250 Metres he failed to make sufficient endeavour to prevent his mount from shifting in which resulted in GOOD METHOD being bumped and taken in across the rightful running of JOY TOGETHER which was checked.  J Moreira was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 16 June 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Happy Valley racemeeting on Thursday, 9 June 2016.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into account J Moreira's good race riding record.  After this, GOLD TARTINI continued to race with its head on the side and lay in.
For the majority of the race, MY FOLKS travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong (JOY TOGETHER) stated that having been instructed to take up a forward position, she rode her mount along out of the barriers.  She said after travelling some distance JOY TOGETHER did not have sufficient speed to be as far forward as hoped as horses to the outside of JOY TOGETHER, namely ACE KING and GOOD METHOD clearly showed more speed than JOY TOGETHER in the early stages.  She said after being crossed by GOOD METHOD, she positioned JOY TOGETHER slightly to the outside of that horse as she anticipated that GOOD METHOD might be shifted to the rail which would have provided her with the opportunity to improve to that horse's outside.  She added near the 1000 Metres it appeared that GOOD METHOD was going to be shifted in and she rode her mount along in order to take advantage of the position one horse off the rail if GOOD METHOD did shift in.  She said however that GOOD METHOD remained racing one horse off the rail and this resulted in JOY TOGETHER racing to the outside of that horse and in a three wide position without cover.  Apprentice Chiong was advised that her explanation would be reported, however, she must, wherever circumstances permit, ensure that her mounts are able to save ground so that they can finish off their race as best as they are able.  A veterinary inspection of JOY TOGETHER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

CHEERFUL FRAME was then shifted out to relieve the tightening to NAMJONG INVINCIBLE and bumped the hindquarters of HOME RUN.
For some distance after the 150 Metres, INVENTION MASTER was held up after being disappointed for a run inside REAL SUPREME which shifted in.  M Chadwick was advised that whilst the Stewards were satisfied that INVENTION MASTER had not established running to the inside of REAL SUPREME, nonetheless he must in similar circumstances make every endeavour to keep his mounts on a straight course.  Because of this incident, INVENTION MASTER was not able to be properly tested over the final stages of the race.
Throughout the race, SUPER MAN travelled wide and without cover.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the prima facie view that an incident occurred over the concluding stages which cast sufficient doubt as to whether SUPER MAN should be declared the 2nd placegetter.  Subsequently Z Purton, the rider of 3rd placed, NAMJONG INVINCIBLE, lodged a protest/objection against SUPER MAN alleging interference to his mount over the concluding stages.  After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, it was established that at about the 20 Metres NAMJONG INVINCIBLE, which had shifted in marginally, became unbalanced after being bumped by SUPER MAN which was directed out in order to prevent causing interference to runners to its inside.  As a result of this shift out from SUPER MAN, that horse and NAMJONG INVINCIBLE continued to make contact right until the finishing line.  The Stewards formed the view that the marginal shift from NAMJONG INVINCIBLE was inconsequential and that the incident was as a result of SUPER MAN shifting out.  Having regard to the manner in which the two horses were finishing off the race, the degree of interference, the proximity of this incident to the finishing line and the short head margin between both horses at the end of the race, the Stewards were comfortable that had it not have been for SUPER MAN shifting out, NAMJONG INVINCIBLE would have finished in front of that horse and accordingly the protest/objection was sustained with the placings amended to read No. 2, HOME RUN, 1st; No. 7, NAMJONG INVINCIBLE, 2nd; No. 4, SUPER MAN, 3rd; and No. 5, HOUSE OF FUN, 4th.
After the race, it was reported that INVENTION MASTER had bled from both nostrils.  An endoscopic examination conducted by the Veterinary Surgeon on INVENTION MASTER confirmed that the horse had bled.

The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered if RESPLENDENT GLORY had been afforded a fair start.  After taking evidence from Z Purton, the rider of RESPLENDENT GLORY and Mr A Speechley, Deputy Starter, who started this race and after viewing the videos, the Stewards found that after being placed in the barriers RESPLENDENT GLORY became fractious and attempted to sit down.  After this, RESPLENDENT GLORY then turned its head initially to the left and then just prior to the start being effected turned its head to the right despite the attempts of the starting gate handler to straighten its head which resulted in the horse being slow to begin.  As the Stewards formed the opinion that RESPLENDENT GLORY's barrier manners were the reason for the horse being slow to begin and that there were no external factors affecting the horse's ability to begin with the field, they found that RESPLENDENT GLORY had been afforded a fair start and accordingly that horse was deemed to be a runner.  The Stewards ruled that RESPLENDENT GLORY, which was having its first race start in Hong Kong tonight, will be required to pass a stalls test prior to its next race start.

When questioned, K Teetan stated that at its most recent start over 1000 Metres, SPEEDY SANDY had finished off its race well after being ridden in about a midfield position.  He said in tonight's race it was felt that there were a number of horses that were drawn more favourably than SPEEDY SANDY which had shown good speed in their races and it was felt that if SPEEDY SANDY had to do too much work in the early stages to cross runners and obtain a position closer to the rail, it would not be able to finish off the race.  He said he was given the option to go forward if SPEEDY SANDY were to begin very well and he was able to assess that a forward position could be obtained without making too much use of the horse.  He said otherwise he was instructed to shift SPEEDY SANDY across behind runners and obtain a position with cover.  He added SPEEDY SANDY began satisfactorily, but he ascertained in the early stages that a significant number of horses were being ridden along to go forward and therefore he felt that it was in the best interests of SPEEDY SANDY for the horse to be shifted across behind runners and obtain cover.  He said when ridden in this manner SPEEDY SANDY finished off the race strongly.

Over the concluding stages, WIN IT raced tight inside BALTIC WARRIOR and consequently was not ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he was instructed to obtain the lead if possible on SPARKLING SWORD and accordingly he rode his mount along aggressively in the early stages.  He said KITAYA and MASSIVE POWER were also ridden along to obtain forward positions and because of this he was left racing in a three wide position passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said although the tempo after the 1200 Metres was not fast, he believed that SPARKLING SWORD was not travelling well enough for him to press forward in an attempt to clear MASSIVE POWER or KITAYA to race closer to the rail.  He said SPARKLING SWORD travelled only fairly in the middle stages and when being ridden along to maintain its position after the 600 Metres got its head on the side and lay in.  He added after this SPARKLING SWORD did not finish off the race and, in his opinion, raced âflatâ.
After the race, K C Leung stated that after being able to obtain a forward position as instructed, MASSIVE POWER travelled satisfactorily until near the 600 Metres at which time the horse came under heavy pressure.

When questioned, G Lerena stated that he had been issued with two sets of instructions, the first being that if GRACE HEART began well, to obtain a forward position as the horse had previously raced well when ridden in this manner.  He said he was also advised that if GRACE HEART did not show its anticipated early speed, he should obtain cover and then ride the horse for luck.  He said after being placed in the barriers GRACE HEART became fractious and then as the start was effected threw its head to the right and then lifted its front feet off the ground which resulted in the horse being slow to begin.  He said due to the manner in which GRACE HEART began, he then shifted the horse across behind runners and obtained inside runs close to the rail.  He added GRACE HEART then finished off the race well in the Straight.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that making the first turn RACING MATE got its head on the side and hung out.  He said after this RACING MATE proved very difficult to settle and had to be checked away from the heels of AIMING HIGH for some distance in the middle stages.  He said RACING MATE again hung out making the turn after the 600 Metres which resulted in it being awkwardly placed close to the heels of AIMING HIGH and racing tight inside SUPREME FALCON.  He added RACING MATE continued to hang out badly and rounding the Home Turn he was reluctant to commence riding the horse along due to its racing manners.  He said after being placed under pressure shortly after entering the Straight RACING MATE did not respond to his riding and failed to make ground in the Straight.  The racing manners of RACING MATE were considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, RACING MATE will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial around a bend.

Passing the 100 Metres, C K Tong (SEMPITERNAL) dropped his right rein.
Over the concluding stages, LITTLE ISLAND raced tight between PO CHING TREASURE and CLASSIC EMPEROR which shifted out marginally.  In this incident, LITTLE ISLAND bumped the hindquarters of PO CHING TREASURE which became unbalanced.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong (PO CHING TREASURE) stated that he had obtained a good trailing position behind CLASSIC EMPEROR in the early stages and he was content to maintain this position throughout the middle stages.  He said however that making the turn after the 1100 Metres PO CHING TREASURE shifted out marginally away from the heels of CLASSIC EMPEROR which was being steadied after the race was run at a good tempo in the early stages.  He said when PO CHING TREASURE shifted out near the 1000 Metres, he attempted to steady it in order to resume his position behind CLASSIC EMPEROR, however, at this time PO CHING TREASURE had advanced to be racing outside the heels of that horse.  He said he also received a call from the rider of BISHOPâS LEAP which improved to be racing inside PO CHING TREASURE.  He said because of this he was not able to shift in and PO CHING TREASURE was consequently required to race three wide and without cover for the remainder of the race.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MALAYAN PEARL, Z Purton stated that in the early stages he was able to take up a forward position on the horse, however, he did have to ride it along to do so.  He said MALAYAN PEARL did not travel well at any stage of the race and he had to ride the horse along after the 1200 Metres in order to maintain its position.  He said he then had to continually ride MALAYAN PEARL along including slapping the horse down the shoulder with the whip on occasions as it was reluctant to hold its position.  He said he continued to ride the horse along after this and passing the 600 Metres was required to ride it with some urgency as MALAYAN PEARL was commencing to give ground.  He said, despite being ridden along, MALAYAN PEARL was unable to maintain its position which allowed THIS IS GLADIATOR to improve inside MALAYAN PEARL.  He added as MALAYAN PEARL was racing like a horse that may be experiencing some internal issues, he eased it down in the Straight.  Mr D Cruz, the trainer of MALAYAN PEARL, stated that he was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of the horse as it had done particularly well since its last start success.  He said he had ridden MALAYAN PEARL on numerous occasions in the lead up to today's race including its final piece of fast work and had pleased him in the manner in which it completed its work.  He said the only possible explanation for the horse's run today was that the race was run at a fast tempo in the middle stages and this may have forced MALAYAN PEARL, which was racing up on the speed, off the bridle sooner than it may ordinarily have been.  He added, irrespective of this, MALAYAN PEARL was very disappointing in that it did not appear to travel well at any stage of the race.  A veterinary inspection of MALAYAN PEARL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MALAYAN PEARL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MALAYAN PEARL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, N Callan stated that as there did not appear to be much pace engaged in the race, he rode his mount along in the early stages from an inside barrier to obtain a midfield position.  He said LOYAL CRAFTSMAN travelled well until WIN CHANCE improved its position after the 1200 Metres at which time his mount came off the bridle.  He said because of this he had to ride LOYAL CRAFTSMAN along, however, the horse was reluctant to maintain its position.  He added he again had to ride LOYAL CRAFTSMAN aggressively after the 700 Metres to prevent SWEET BEAN from shifting out to his inside and then after that had to continue to ride the horse along as LOYAL CRAFTSMAN was not improving its position at that time.  He said he shifted LOYAL CRAFTSMAN to the outside in the Straight and, after staying on fairly in the early part of the Straight, was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

When questioned regarding the performance of ROUGE ET BLANC, N Rawiller stated that, from barrier 13, he was asked to be positive on the horse and obtain a forward position.  He said he had to make some use of ROUGE ET BLANC in the early stages to cross runners to his inside so as to avoid being obliged to race unnecessarily wide.  He said he commenced to ride ROUGE ET BLANC along prior to the Home Turn as it is one-paced and was dropping back in distance today, therefore he wanted to ensure that the horse was not left flat-footed when the pace of the race quickened.  He added however that after being placed under pressure, ROUGE ET BLANC immediately came under pressure and then, despite being ridden out in the early part of the Straight, did not respond and gave ground over the latter stages of the Straight.  He said the performance of ROUGE ET BLANC was attributable to the amount of use that had to be made of the horse in the early stages to cross runners from its wide barrier.

K Teetan was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 20 June 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).

Approaching the 100 Metres, SUPERNATURAL was steadied when awkwardly placed outside the heels of PEARL HARBOUR.
When questioned, K Teetan stated that he was asked to ride his mount positively as it was felt that horses that were racing on the speed were more advantaged on todayâs track than those that were required to race back in the field.  He said he was asked to attempt to obtain cover behind the speed if possible, however, if ROYALE ELEGANCE was left racing wide and without cover, he should then allow the horse to improve to obtain a position closer to the rail.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages and making the first turn near the 900 Metres was left racing three wide.  He said for this reason he allowed ROYALE ELEGANCE to improve into the lead after the 700 Metres and the horse then responded well to his riding and was only beaten in the concluding stages of the race.  He added the manner in which ROYALE ELEGANCE performed today indicated to him that the horse was somewhat versatile and did not necessarily need to be ridden near the rear of the field.  Mr J Moore, the trainer of ROYALE ELEGANCE, confirmed that it had been intended for ROYALE ELEGANCE to be ridden more forward than is usual, however, not to be ridden in the lead.  He said a number of riders of horses trained by him earlier in the day had indicated that it was difficult to improve from the rear of the field on todayâs track and it had been hoped that, from the wide barrier, ROYALE ELEGANCE may be able to obtain a position behind the speed with cover.  He also confirmed he advised Jockey Teetan that if ROYALE ELEGANCE, due to the wide barrier, was required to race wide and without cover along the Back Straight, he should allow his mount to improve its position rounding the turn in an endeavour to obtain a position closer to the rail.

He was advised that the Stewards would monitor KINGSTON JUMBO in its future starts and if at any time the Stewards were of the opinion that the horse presented a safety risk, then it may be that they would be required to consider its suitability to race.

When questioned regarding his riding of WINNING LEADER, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he was instructed to lead on the horse as it had performed well when ridden in that fashion at its last start.  He said after riding his mount along in the initial stages of the race to obtain the lead, he then attempted to steady WINNING LEADER after the 1600 Metres and the horse initially settled well.  He said although WINNING LEADER was going slightly quicker than he had intended after the 1400 Metres, the horse then commenced to travel stronger approaching and passing the 1200 Metres when RICKFIELD improved its position to be racing outside WINNING LEADER.  He added he attempted to steady the tempo on WINNING LEADER, however, the horse was travelling strongly and he was reluctant to restrain it too much in case it broke its stride and would over-race.  He said he tried to steady the tempo as best as he could without restraining the horse too heavily, however, WINNING LEADER continued to travel strongly in the lead and opened up a margin over the remainder of the field, particularly after the 900 Metres.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of WINNING LEADER, confirmed that he had instructed Apprentice Wong to obtain the lead on the horse if possible, however, if another horse was intent on leading, he should be prepared to allow that horse to cross and for WINNING LEADER to then take a trailing position.  He said he was of the opinion that WINNING LEADER had run the race slightly too quick at its most recent start when ridden by Apprentice Wong and therefore he asked Apprentice Wong, if possible, to rate WINNING LEADER better in front than he had on that occasion so as to allow the horse to be able to finish off the race strongly.  Apprentice Wong was advised that although he is a 7 lb claiming apprentice jockey, nonetheless he had had a significant number of rides in Hong Kong which includes 30 race wins.  He was further advised that his riding of WINNING LEADER was not up to the standard expected of any rider in Hong Kong in that the horse was required to run at a particularly fast tempo which meant that it then was not able to finish off the race.  Having regard to Apprentice Wong's level of experience, the Stewards decided in the circumstances to issue a severe reprimand, however, he was advised that were he to ride a horse in a similar manner in the future, it may be that the Stewards would consider issuing a charge of having breached the Rules of Racing.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of GLOBE TROTTER, Apprentice H N Wong stated that his mount was more relaxed prior to today's race than it was at its most recent start.  He said although he had to make some use of the horse in the early stages to lead, he felt that he had to make more use of it last start when it was successful.  He added GLOBE TROTTER travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages and, after being placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn, gave him a limited response in the early part of the Straight, however, came under pressure after the 200 Metres and then was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened over the concluding stages.

When questioned, O Doleuze (ACCEPTED) stated that he had been asked not to ride his mount along in the early stages as ACCEPTED has known to over-race and prove difficult to settle.  He said after being bumped at the start he shifted his mount across behind runners to obtain a position outside TRAVEL DATUK approaching the 1100 Metres.  He said making the first turn passing the 1000 Metres he received a call from M L Yeung, the rider of TRAVEL DATUK, to alert him that the horse was still racing to the inside of ACCEPTED.  He said at this time he was comfortable to race one horse off the rail as he was racing behind BACK IN BLACK which he considered to be a strong chance in the race.  He said near the 800 Metres ACCEPTED commenced to travel keenly and at this time he considered shifting to the inside of BACK IN BLACK to take up a position on the rail behind APOLLO'S CHOICE, however, at this time TRAVEL DATUK had improved to be racing to the inside of the heels of ACCEPTED and for this reason he did not shift in.  He said however he was still content to race behind BACK IN BLACK.  He added after this ACCEPTED commenced to prove very difficult to settle and for a considerable distance was checked away from the heels of BACK IN BLACK which did not take him into the race as he anticipated it would.  A veterinary inspection of ACCEPTED immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, ACCEPTED will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, K Teetan stated that BACK IN BLACK travelled keenly to the Start and then, during the race, travelled only fairly.  He said making the Home Turn  he had to niggle at BACK IN BLACK in an endeavour to have the horse improve its position.  He said in previous starts when he had ridden BACK IN BLACK, the horse had travelled stronger at this stage of the race and it was of concern to him that he had to ride it along at this time.  He said in the early part of the Straight BACK IN BLACK lay in and then weakened over the latter stages.  He added, in his opinion, BACK IN BLACK raced like a tired horse.  Trainer P O'Sullivan subsequently confirmed that it was his intention to spell BACK IN BLACK following today's disappointing performance.  A veterinary inspection of BACK IN BLACK immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of HIGH FIVE immediately following the race revealed that the horse was displaying an irregular heart rhythm.  Before being allowed to race again, HIGH FIVE will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

She said in the early stages she attempted to obtain a trailing position behind KING OF MONGOLIA and in advance of EXPEDITE, however, was unable to obtain this position as EXPEDITE maintained its position to the inside of SUPER FLUKE which obliged SUPER FLUKE to race wide and without cover after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  She stated that although the tempo of the race slackened noticeably after the 1200 Metres, she was reluctant to allow her mount to improve at this time due to her instructions and the fact that SUPER FLUKE was travelling comfortably.  She added passing the 800 Metres she commenced to improve her position on SUPER FLUKE in an endeavour to prevent INDUSTRIALIST WAY, which was racing to the inside of SUPER FLUKE, from being able to shift out, however, that horse was able to shift out away from the heels of TEN FLAMES after the 600 Metres which resulted in SUPER FLUKE being taken wider.  Apprentice Chiong was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, she should have made more of an endeavour after the 800 Metres to ride her mount forward of INDUSTRIALIST WAY so as to prevent that horse from being able to shift out and also prevent SUPER FLUKE from being taken unnecessarily wide.
When questioned, B Prebble stated that he had been asked to ride REGENCY KING where it was comfortable.  He said in the early stages he allowed REGENCY KING to obtain a forward position, however, the horse did not show early speed and consequently he shifted it across behind runners.

When questioned, K C Leung stated that he was asked to ride RED KYLIN behind the leaders if possible as it was anticipated that today's race would be run at a good tempo.  He said RED KYLIN began fairly and runners drawn both inside and outside of RED KYLIN were ridden to take up forward positions in the early stages.  He said had he have continued to ride RED KYLIN forward to obtain a position as instructed, he believed that the horse would have been left racing unnecessarily wide and for this reason he elected to steady RED KYLIN after the 1100 Metres to obtain a position with cover.  He said this resulted in RED KYLIN racing further back in the field than had been anticipated.  He added RED KYLIN travelled satisfactorily throughout the middle stages and after being shifted to the outside of runners in the Straight initially responded well to his riding.  He said however that after the 200 Metres RED KYLIN did not finish off, was one-paced and, in his opinion, may not have been suited by today's track conditions.

When questioned, K C Ng stated that he was asked to ride FULL GLORY quietly in the early stages to ensure that the horse settled as it had performed well when ridden in this manner at its last start.  He said after being crowded for room shortly after the start FULL GLORY then travelled keenly and would not relax as he had hoped and raced disappointingly.  He added whilst the horse may not have been suited by todayâs track conditions and, bearing in mind that it had been successful on âGood to Firmâ track at its last start, he believed that FULL GLORY travelling keenly in the early and middle stages had also had a bearing on the horseâs performance.

He said whilst EASY HEDGE had previously performed satisfactorily on a rain affected track, he felt todayâs disappointing performance could be attributed to a combination of the horse being first up since February and the track conditions which may have had an effect on the horseâs ability to close off.  A veterinary inspection of EASY HEDGE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN was also shifted across behind runners from a wide barrier shortly after the start.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, GLORY STAR was steadied when crowded for room inside WONDERFUL JOURNEY which was taken in marginally by GREAT TOPLIGHT which in turn shifted in away from WISKY.
After passing the winning post on the first occasion, BEST EFFORT got its head on the side and lay out.
After the 1200 Metres, PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN was left racing wide and without cover.

In the Straight, BEST HOPE (Apprentice K K Chiong) raced with its head on the side and lay in and after the 150 Metres shifted in and hampered WONDERFUL JOURNEY which was steadied away from the heels of BEST HOPE.  Apprentice Chiong was advised that whilst the Stewards acknowledged that BEST HOPE was laying in and proving difficult to ride, nonetheless in similar circumstances she must make every endeavour to prevent her mounts from shifting ground.
O Doleuze (GREAT TOPLIGHT) was reminded of his obligation to ensure that he does not raise his whip arm above the height of his shoulder.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of GLORY STAR, T H So stated that he rode his mount along vigorously in the early stages to take up a forward position, however, GLORY STAR did not show early speed and was required to race further back in the field than had been intended.  He said GLORY STAR did not travel on the bridle at any stage of the race and, after being placed under pressure prior to the Home Turn, did not respond to his riding and was disappointing.  Mr C S Shum, the trainer of GLORY STAR, informed the Stewards that it is now his intention to spell GLORY STAR following tonight's race.  A veterinary inspection of GLORY STAR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of PEARL FURU and SILVER GATSBY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

                After being placed in the barriers, SPEEDY SANDY became fractious and lunged at the front gates, resulting in Apprentice K K Chiong being dislodged and SPEEDY SANDY leaving the barriers riderless and then galloping a circuit of the course.  Acting on advice from the Veterinary Officer that SPEEDY SANDY was not suitable to race, that horse was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  This resulted in a delay to the start.  Before being allowed to race again, SPEEDY SANDY will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.  Apprentice Chiong was subsequently examined by the Club's medical officers and passed fit to fulfil her remaining race riding engagements.

In this incident, LUCKY CELEBRITY shifted in, resulting in RAINBOW FIGHTER being crowded for room.  Apprentice Chiong was severely reprimanded and advised that she had been spoken to on a number of occasions this season regarding shifting in when under the required clearance.  She was told she must ensure that she is sufficiently clear when shifting ground in future.
When questioned regarding his riding of BOTH LUCKY, particularly after the 800 Metres, O Doleuze stated that from a wide barrier he had been instructed to shift his mount across behind runners, obtain a position on the rail and take advantage of inside runs in the Straight wherever possible.  He said in accordance with his instructions he shifted BOTH LUCKY across behind runners and near the 850 Metres shifted away from the rail towards the outside of the heels of TRENDY WIN as that horse was being hard ridden.  He said whilst there was an opportunity to continue to improve outside TRENDY WIN, as he was instructed to obtain inside runs in the Straight, he felt that it was a better option for him to shift back in and race behind TRENDY WIN.  He said he continued to follow that horse rounding the Home Turn and at the entrance to the Straight immediately shifted his mount to the inside of runners and when able to obtain clear running in the Straight, he was able to fully test BOTH LUCKY.  Trainer C Fownes confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Doleuze and stated, after viewing the videos, that it would be acceptable to him for Jockey Doleuze to continue to improve on BOTH LUCKY and obtain a more forward position after the 800 Metres.  O Doleuze was advised that his riding of BOTH LUCKY from after the 800 Metres had come under notice and that, regardless of his instructions, he should have shown more judgement than he did on this occasion by improving to the outside of TRENDY WIN which would have afforded BOTH LUCKY the opportunity to follow HAPPY LIFE, the race favourite, in the middle stages.  He was advised to ensure that he shows initiative in races in order to take advantage of opportunities to improve his position so as to afford his mounts full opportunity to win or to obtain the best possible placing.

A veterinary inspection of TRAVEL RENYI immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned, K C Leung (SIMPLY INVINCIBLE) stated that after shifting his mount across behind runners from the outside barrier, SIMPLY INVINCIBLE, which was having its first start at Happy Valley tonight, became unbalanced in its action passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said after this SIMPLY INVINCIBLE lost ground, so he commenced to ride his mount along prior to the 1300 Metres in an endeavour to have it join the main body of the field.  He said he continued to ride SIMPLY INVINCIBLE along for a considerable distance, however, the horse would not improve its position and again became unbalanced in its action.  He added after the 900 Metres he continued to ride SIMPLY INVINCIBLE along and as the horse had become detached from the field, he was concerned that it may be experiencing internal problems and for this reason he eased it out of the race.  A veterinary inspection of SIMPLY INVINCIBLE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SIMPLY INVINCIBLE was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SIMPLY INVINCIBLE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said in accordance with his instructions he shifted LAUGH OUT LOUD across behind runners soon after the start but then had to ride his mount vigorously for some distance in the early stages as LAUGH OUT LOUD was becoming detached from the main body of the field.  He added after the 1200 Metres he had to use the whip on the horse on a number of occasions in order to ensure that it did not get too far out of its ground.  He said however that LAUGH OUT LOUD did not travel well at any stage of the race and then did not close off.

VICTORY FOLLOW ME began only fairly.
From the outside barriers, HROVAT and ROUNDABOUT were steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Over the final 200 Metres, TRAVEL COMFORTS shifted out under pressure.
When questioned, Z Purton stated that LAMAROSA began awkwardly, resulting in him becoming unbalanced.  He said in the early stages he shifted LAMAROSA across in order to take a trailing position behind CALL ME ACHIEVER which was being hard ridden.  He said after the 800 Metres he expected CALL ME ACHIEVER to shift in towards the rail as the rider of that horse was looking to his inside.  He said however that CALL ME ACHIEVER remained racing in a position one horse off the rail which resulted in LAMAROSA being left in a three wide position without cover.  He said as he did not believe LAMAROSA had sufficient speed to cross CALL ME ACHIEVER and obtain a position in front of that horse, he elected to steady LAMAROSA and obtain a trailing position behind CALL ME ACHIEVER to avoid covering unnecessary ground.  He added rounding the Home Turn he rode LAMAROSA vigorously to make up ground and continued to ride the horse out hands and heels until after the 200 Metres at which time he commenced to use the whip on the horse and it finished off the race well.
When questioned regarding his riding of HROVAT in the Straight, O Bosson stated that he placed the horse under pressure rounding the Home Turn, however, HROVAT did not quicken in the early part of the Straight.  He said approaching the 200 Metres HROVAT got its head on the side and lay out and then near the 100 Metres was momentarily awkwardly placed close to the heels of CALL ME ACHIEVER.  He said after shifting to the inside of that horse, he improved between OCEAN ROAR which was giving ground and CALL ME ACHIEVER.  He said as HROVAT was only having its second race start in Hong Kong tonight and racing greenly and given that OCEAN ROAR and CALL ME ACHIEVER were not finishing off their races, he did not persist in testing his mount as the race was in its concluding stages and he felt that either horse may shift ground, resulting in HROVAT being crowded for room.  O Bosson was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he was told to ensure that he places his mounts under appropriate pressure to ensure that they finish off their races as best as they are able.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that despite riding OCEAN ROAR aggressively in the early stages, the horse did not show the same speed as TRAVEL COMFORTS which was able to cross OCEAN ROAR after the 800 Metres.  He said after this OCEAN ROAR was always off the bridle when ridden along in order to maintain its position.  He said OCEAN ROAR came under pressure rounding the Home Turn and then in the Straight weakened out of the race.  He added the fact that OCEAN ROAR was not able to lead was the principal reason for the horse's failure to finish off its race.  A veterinary inspection of OCEAN ROAR immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse's trachea.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of RUGBY DIAMOND, Z Purton stated that he had to make slightly more use of the horse in the early stages to obtain a forward position than he did last start when the horse was successful.  He said he first become concerned with the manner in which RUGBY DIAMOND was travelling when it was not as fluent in its action approaching and passing the 800 Metres.  He said RUGBY DIAMOND did not travel into the race as strongly as he expected when GIDDY GIDDY improved to the outside of RUGBY DIAMOND approaching the 400 Metres and then rounding the Home Turn immediately came under pressure and did not respond to his riding.  He added RUGBY DIAMOND gave ground rapidly in the early part of the Straight which caused him to think that something may be amiss with the horse.  He said in the absence of any veterinary explanation for RUGBY DIAMOND's run and having regard to the fact that the horse was not as fluent in its action in the early stages as it was last start, he felt that the horse may have jarred up on tonight's track.  Mr W Y So, the trainer of RUGBY DIAMOND, said he was at a loss to explain the horse's performance as RUGBY DIAMOND had done particularly well since its last start success and it was expected that the horse would again race well tonight.  A veterinary inspection of RUGBY DIAMOND immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of RUGBY DIAMOND was considered unacceptable.

                After the 1400 Metres, SLEDGE HAMMER, which was travelling wide and without cover, got its head on the side and attempted to hang out.  SLEDGE HAMMER was able to be brought back to the main body of the field after the 1300 Metres.
After the 1200 Metres, DRAGON ENERGY got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of DRAGON HARMONY which was being steadied away from the heels of MY CUP OVERFLOWS.  This resulted in DRAGON ENERGY losing ground.
Making the turn after the 1200 Metres, FLYING MACHINE got its head on the side and lay out.
After the 1100 Metres, DRAGON GLORY was left racing wide and without cover.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HAPPY FRIENDSHIP, J Moreira stated that the horse was able to enjoy a good run behind the speed on the rail.  He said after making the turn near the 700 Metres he was awkwardly positioned inside MY CUP OVERFLOWS and attempted to improve inside that horse and from behind CHOICE EXCHEQUER near the 500 Metres.  He said he was not able to immediately shift out due to MY CUP OVERFLOWS maintaining its position.  He said passing the 400 Metres he was able to shift out from behind CHOICE EXCHEQUER, however, HAPPY FRIENDSHIP was inclined to lay in and proved difficult to ride.  He added near the 200 Metres HAPPY FRIENDSHIP, which was continuing to lay in, was awkwardly placed outside DRAGON GLORY, however, at this time the horse was already under heavy pressure and after this was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of HAPPY FRIENDSHIP immediately following the race revealed the horse to have an epiglottic entrapment.
When questioned regarding her riding of GLAMOROUS RYDER after the 600 Metres, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that she was following SPICY SIAM.  She said at this stage the horse was under heavy pressure, however, she felt that it was better in the circumstances to wait until the top of the Straight to make her finishing run rather than shifting to the outside of that horse which would have resulted in GLAMOROUS RYDER being forced very wide.  She said she was unaware at this time that a run was developing between REUNITED and DRAGON GLORY which was racing directly to the inside of SPICY SIAM.  She said when DRAGON GLORY commenced to improve its position after the 400 Metres, she followed that horse into the Straight and GLAMOROUS RYDER then finished off the race well.  Apprentice Chiong was advised that her explanation would be reported, however, she must ensure that, wherever possible, she takes advantage of opportunities to improve her position so that her mounts do not get too far out of their ground.
After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that MIZZEN GREY had sustained lacerations to the right front cannon and fetlock.

                After being loaded, ENTRUSTING became fractious and reared, resulting in its rider, C Schofield being dislodged.  In this incident, the hood/visor and bridle carried by ENTRUSTING came loose.  Whilst this gear was refitted to ENTRUSTING, the horse stood quietly in the barriers.  After the gear was reapplied, ENTRUSTING was removed from the barriers and examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.  C Schofield was examined by the Clubâs medical officers and passed fit to fulfil his riding engagement.  Having regard to ENTRUSTINGâs previous record, the Stewards ruled that the horse must barrier trial satisfactorily prior to its next race start.
ENTRUSTING blundered badly at the start.

Approaching the 200 Metres, SIR JOHN and LET ME DO bumped.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to ride LET ME DO positively and obtain a position behind the speed as it was expected that a number of runners would go forward to contest the lead which would afford LET ME DO a good trailing position with cover.  He said in the early stages he rode his mount along in accordance with his instructions and passing the winning post on the first occasion he immediately attempted to steady LET ME DO and obtain a trailing position behind SIR JOHN and in advance of HO LEE HORSE.  He said at this time there was not sufficient room to shift in behind SIR JOHN, however, he observed that TRENDY WORLD was being ridden along from a wide barrier and therefore he continued to steady LET ME DO in the hope that TRENDY WORLD would be able to clear LET ME DO and race outside SIR JOHN which would provide LET ME DO with cover albeit in a three wide position.  He said however that when he endeavoured to steady LET ME DO, it commenced to prove difficult to settle after the 1500 Metres and particularly passing the 1400 Metres, therefore he was not able to have the horse relax.  He said when TRENDY WORLD improved to be racing outside and in advance of LET ME DO, this had the effect of firing up LET ME DO which further compounded the difficulties he was experiencing having LET ME DO to steady.  He added although he was aware the tempo of the race was commencing to become quite fast, the racing manners of LET ME DO would not allow him to come back and relieve some of the pressure that was being applied to the tempo of the race.  He said given the manner in which LET ME DO was racing after the 1200 Metres, he felt it was best to discontinue trying to restrain that horse and allow LET ME DO to improve its position in the hope that the rider of SIR JOHN would steady and he would be able to cross and obtain the position one horse off the rail outside DASHING SUPER.  He further stated he had noted that SIR JOHN had on occasions been ridden behind the speed and he had hoped that this would occur when he was not able to steady LET ME DO.  He said however that SIR JOHN continued to hold its position and consequently LET ME DO was required to race three wide until after the 900 Metres at which time he was able to cross in front of that horse.  Trainer D J Hall stated that as LET ME DO was having its first start on the All Weather track, he asked Jockey Yeung to ride the horse in the front half of the field as he expected that the race would be run at a good tempo with a number of anticipated speed horses.  He said he was disappointed in Jockey Yeungâs riding of LET ME DO from approaching the winning post on the first occasion.  He said he felt that there was an opportunity to either attempt to shift behind SIR JOHN or to steady LET ME DO and obtain a trailing position behind TRENDY WORLD.  He added in the circumstances he felt that M L Yeung should have done more to steady LET ME DO than he did on this occasion in order to execute his riding instructions.  Mr Hall was advised that his evidence would be reported.  M L Yeung was severely reprimanded regarding his riding of LET ME DO in the early and middle stages.  He was advised that whilst the Stewards accepted that he had made an effort to steady LET ME DO passing the winning post on the first occasion, given his instructions and the fact that TRENDY WORLD was improving around LET ME DO, he should have made a far greater effort than he did to steady LET ME DO.  M L Yeung was told to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so as to leave no room for query.
When questioned regarding his riding of TRENDY WORLD in the early and middle stages, K C Leung stated that he had been asked to obtain the lead if possible, however, if he was not able to do so, he should take a trailing position. He said on jumping TRENDY WORLD stumbled and he then rode his mount along for some distance in the run to the winning post on the first occasion as it was apparent to him that the rider of LET ME DO, which was positioned to the inside of TRENDY WORLD, was looking to steady his mount and therefore he continued to press on in order to cross that horse.  He said he was aware that SIR JOHN had on occasions been ridden with cover at the distance and therefore he felt that after being able to cross LET ME DO, he may be able to then cross SIR JOHN which would allow TRENDY WORLD the opportunity to race outside DASHING SUPER.  He added LET ME DO maintained its position inside TRENDY WORLD as that horse was not able to be steadied to take a trailing position.  He said as he was racing in a four wide position, he continued forward of that horse after the 1200 Metres, however, approaching the 1000 Metres it became apparent that LET ME DO was going to continue to race to the inside of TRENDY WORLD and for this reason he then restrained the horse in an attempt to obtain a position with cover.  He said when LET ME DO pressed on to improve to race outside the lead, TRENDY WORLD was then left racing wide and without cover and commenced to give ground from after the 800 Metres.  Trainer L Ho stated that as TRENDY WORLD was having its first start on the All Weather track today and was stepping up in distance, he felt that there was an opportunity for TRENDY WORLD to obtain a forward position hopefully on the rail but in any case outside DASHING SUPER.  He added he anticipated that SIR JOHN may be ridden with cover so he felt that, in the circumstances, it would be likely that TRENDY WORLD would be able to go forward without having too much use made of it.  He said he did not anticipate that LET ME DO would be part of the speed equation and given the circumstances of the race in the early stages and the endeavour that K C Leung had made to follow his instructions in the early stages, he was satisfied with his riding of the horse.  Mr Ho was advised that his evidence would be reported.  K C Leung was told that the Stewards believed it was reasonable for him, given his instructions, to attempt to obtain a forward position and that it was also reasonable for him to have expected either LET ME DO or SIR JOHN to be steadied to allow TRENDY WORLD to race outside the lead.  However, he was told that the Stewards would have expected him to be more aware of the circumstances of the race approaching the 1200 Metres and to have steadied his mount earlier than he did in order to attempt to obtain a position off the speed.  The performance of TRENDY WORLD, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, TRENDY WORLD will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned regarding her riding of SUN TOUCH, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that after not beginning well, SUN TOUCH raced back in the field and due to the fast tempo of the race was a considerable distance from the leaders after the 600 Metres.  She said she rode her mount along rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight commenced to use the whip on the horse.  She said SUN TOUCH initially did not respond to her riding, however, she continued to ride the horse including continuing to use the whip on SUN TOUCH.  She added after the 200 Metres as SUN TOUCH did not appear to be closing off the race, she elected to cease using the whip and pushed the horse out hands and heels.  She said approaching the 100 Metres she shifted SUN TOUCH, which was inclined to lay in, to the outside of the heels of SUPREME FALCON and then continued to push the horse all the way to the end of the race.  Apprentice Chiong was told that her riding of SUN TOUCH, particularly over the last 200 Metres, had come under notice.  She was advised to ensure that she rides her mounts in such a manner so as to leave no room for query.  A veterinary inspection of SUN TOUCH immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding his riding of LOVE SHOCK, J Moreira stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 12, to ride the horse positively in the early stages and obtain a forward position.  He said it was anticipated that the only established leader in the race was CHEVALIER STAR and that there would be an opportunity for LOVE SHOCK to shift over to race outside that horse.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode LOVE SHOCK along in the early stages and the horse initially showed superior speed to CHEVALIER STAR.  He said shortly after the start he became aware that SHINNING MOON was being ridden forward from an inside barrier, however, he was unsure whether that horse would continue to be part of the speed in the early stages.  He said for some distance after the start LOVE SHOCK raced on terms with CHEVALIER STAR, however, after the 1000 Metres he felt that LOVE SHOCK was showing superior speed to CHEVALIER STAR and therefore he continued to ride his mount forward in an endeavour to cross that horse.  He added after the 1000 Metres SHINNING MOON and CHEVALIER STAR continued to maintain their positions to the inside of LOVE SHOCK and, despite his efforts, he was unable to clear CHEVALIER STAR and race closer to the rail which resulted in LOVE SHOCK racing in a three wide position without cover throughout the race.  He said whilst he was aware that a gap had opened up behind the leading horses and to the main body of the field, he had committed LOVE SHOCK to go forward at this time and that he did not believe that it was a viable option to then steady his mount and obtain a trailing position behind CHEVALIER STAR.  J Moreira was advised that, in the opinion of the Stewards, his riding of LOVE SHOCK felt short of what is expected of a senior rider, in particular one of his standing.  He was told that given the established racing pattern of CHEVALIER STAR which is noted to have led in a majority of its race starts, he should have steadied LOVE SHOCK after the 1100 Metres to attempt to obtain a trailing position behind CHEVALIER STAR.  J Moreira was severely reprimanded and reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts in such a manner so that they do not cover unnecessary ground and are provided with every opportunity to finish off their races to the best of their ability.

Acting on this advice, UNICORN was withdrawn by order of the Stewards.  Before being allowed to race again, UNICORN will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Also on arrival at the barriers, M L Yeung (RED DANCER) expressed concern regarding that horse's action.  RED DANCER was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said, after the necessary consultations, that the horse was suitable to race.
VANILLA began only fairly and then shortly after the start was shifted across behind runners.
From wide barriers, TERRIFIC MASTER, MONEY MAN and RICKFIELD were steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.

The performance of MONEY MAN, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MONEY MAN will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that as it was anticipated that the race would not be run at a fast tempo and as there was only one established leader, namely CLUB LIFE, she was asked, due to the weight allowance, to be positive on KIRAM and obtain a forward position.  She said she was instructed if no other rider was intent on leading, she could lead, however, if CLUB LIFE went forward, she should shift to the outside of that horse.  She said in accordance with her instructions she rode her mount along and was able to shift in outside CLUB LIFE after the 1400 Metres.  She said she immediately attempted to steady KIRAM, however, the horse commenced to prove very difficult to settle and, despite her efforts, she was not able to get KIRAM to relax.  She said she went for the another hold on the horse after the 1200 Metres in an endeavour to have it steady, however, KIRAM continued to race keenly.  She said rather than continuing to fight KIRAM, she allowed that horse to improve slightly after the 1100 Metres to establish whether the rider of CLUB LIFE was prepared to hand up the lead.  She added however that CLUB LIFE continued to maintain its position which resulted in her again having to steady KIRAM in an endeavour to have the horse settle so that it could finish off the race.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on ATHENA BABY at the request of Trainer C S Shum.  The Veterinary Surgeon reported that this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, ATHENA BABY will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of RAZOR QUEST immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
ATHENA BABY and CALIFORNIA JOY were sent for sampling.

He said in accordance with his instructions, he steadied CALL ME HANDSOME in the early stages in order to be shifted across behind initially HOLY UNICORN.  He said when he did this, CALL ME HANDSOME got its head on the side and would not shift across behind runners.  He said when CALL ME HANDSOME was left racing very wide after the 1100 Metres and it was no longer available for him to steady the horse given that CALL ME HANDSOME was laying out and travelling keenly, he rode it forward to race outside the leader BEAR CHUM.  He added CALL ME HANDSOME continued to race keenly and lay out making the turns when required to race in a position much further forward than had been intended.

In the early stages, CHOICE TREASURE travelled wide and without cover and after the 1300 Metres improved around the field to assume the lead after the 1000 Metres.
Passing the 1100 Metres, LOTUS BREEZE commenced to prove difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions when being checked away from the heels of ULTIMATE GLORY.  PO CHING TREASURE, which was following LOTUS BREEZE, got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse passing the 800 Metres.
Approaching the 800 Metres, SURE PEACE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GRAND PLUS and making the turn near the 700 Metres became unbalanced when being checked away from the heels of that horse and in doing so shifted in and made heavy contact with the hindquarters of FORMULA WON which became unbalanced.

At the entrance to the Straight, SWEET HOME was shifted in away from the heels of MARVEL HERO and near the 100 Metres was shifted out from behind PAKISTAN BABY to continue improving.
Throughout the race, LUCKY GUY travelled wide and without cover.
The performance of PRINCIPAL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, PRINCIPAL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After the race, M Chadwick reported that PAKISTAN BABY lay in under pressure in the Straight and was reluctant to shift to the outside of KINGSFIELD.  He said over the concluding stages PAKISTAN BABY was awkwardly placed close to the heels of KINGSFIELD and consequently was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.  The Stewards accepted that PAKISTAN BABY was laying in which ultimately resulted in the horse being awkwardly placed close to the heels of KINGSFIELD over the concluding stages and accordingly accepted the evidence provided by M Chadwick.
When questioned, K Teetan stated that, from the outside barrier, he was asked to ride GLENEALY PRIZE in a forward position as it was expected that today's race may not be run at a good temp.  He said he was advised however that if GLENEALY PRIZE did not have sufficient speed to cross runners to its inside, he should attempt to obtain a position with cover on that horse.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode GLENEALY PRIZE along in the early stages, however, KINGSFIELD, which was racing to the inside of GLENEALY PRIZE, clearly showed more speed than his mount.  He said when he observed DR LISTENING being ridden to obtain a forward position inside KINGSFIELD, he elected to steady his mount and attempt to find a position with cover behind LUCKY GUY.  He said however that GOLDEN SUN was ridden along to maintain its position to the inside of GLENEALY PRIZE and as a consequence GLENEALY PRIZE was then left racing wide and without cover throughout the race.
When questioned, Apprentice K K Chiong stated that she was asked to ride PIKACHU in a handy position if the horse began well, however, if it did not jump well, then she should take her mount across behind runners and ride it where it was comfortable.  She said PIKACHU began only fairly and therefore she did not believe it was an option to ride the horse in a handy position and accordingly she shifted PIKACHU across behind runners in the early stages.  She said the race was run at a good tempo which resulted in PIKACHU getting out of its ground in the middle stages.  She added at the entrance to the Straight she immediately commenced to ride the horse along whilst shifting it towards the outside and then over the concluding stages PIKACHU finished off the race strongly.  Apprentice Chiong was advised that her explanation would be reported, however, she should have ridden her mount along after the 600 Metres to make up ground on the main body of the field.  She was also told that she must ride her mounts in such a manner so that they are not left with too much to do.

Shortly after the start, C P POWER shifted in and bumped EVEREST.
In the early stages, GO BEAUTY GO was shifted across behind runners.
M L Yeung (ART OF SUCCESS) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the 800 Metres he failed to make sufficient effort to prevent that horse from shifting out, resulting in SOCKET KING and SPEEDY SANDY being badly crowded for room, becoming unbalanced and losing ground.  In this incident, FUNNY BUDDIES also became badly unbalanced after being bumped on a number of occasions by SPEEDY SANDY.  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into consideration the racing manners of ART OF SUCCESS which lay out and that Jockey Yeung had made a belated attempt to direct ART OF SUCCESS in to relieve the tightening to SOCKET KING and SPEEDY SANDY.  In the circumstances, the Stewards believed the appropriate penalty was for M L Yeung to be fined the sum of $70,000 in lieu of a suspension for a period incorporating two racedays.
Over the final 500 Metres, GO BEAUTY GO raced greenly, shifted ground on a number of occasions and was inclined to hang out.
Approaching and for some distance after the 400 Metres, EVEREST hung in and proved very difficult to ride.
ART OF SUCCESS hung out under pressure after the 400 Metres.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in whilst they considered if WILD BOY had been afforded a fair start.  Evidence was taken from Apprentice K K Chiong, the rider of WILD BOY and Mr A Speechley, Deputy Starter, who started this race.  After reviewing the videos, it was established that after being loaded into the barriers, WILD BOY reared.  WILD BOY then stood satisfactorily, however, as the start was effected again reared abruptly, resulting in the horse missing the start badly and losing a significant amount of ground.  The Stewards accepted the evidence of both Apprentice Chiong and Mr Speechley that whilst the starting gate handler assisting WILD BOY still had hold of the left rein as the horse was rearing, he was merely attempting to assist it and in no way played any part in the horse's action as the start was effected.  Accordingly, the Stewards deemed that WILD BOY had been afforded a fair start and consequently declared that horse to be a runner.  Before being allowed to race again, WILD BOY will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial.
A veterinary inspection of SPEEDY SANDY immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, SPEEDY SANDY will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

STEP HIGH was unable to secure clear running from passing the 400 Metres until after the 100 Metres.
When questioned, D Whyte stated that he was instructed to go forward on FINE ROCK and lead if possible.  He said in the early stages he rode his mount along, however, FINE ROCK did not show the same speed as BEST HOPE and AZTEC EMPIRE which were crossing from wide draws and he felt that he would have had to ride FINE ROCK too aggressively in the early stages to lead.  He said therefore hr allowed those two horses to cross FINE ROCK and when AZTEC EMPIRE crossed BEST HOPE near the 1100 Metres, he attempted to improve his position on FINE ROCK to prevent BEST HOPE from shifting out, however, FINE ROCK got its head on the side, lay out and was reluctant to improve its position at this time.  He added passing the 1100 Metres he noticed that the rider of BEST HOPE was commencing to shift that horse out and given the manner in which FINE ROCK was travelling at this time, he did not believe it was available for him to ride forward to prevent BEST HOPE from shifting out.  He said rather he attempted to steady FINE ROCK and obtain a trailing position behind that horse.  He said however at this time FINE ROCK continued to lay out and then got its head up when being steadied as the tempo of the race slowed appreciably.  He said due to the racing manners of FINE ROCK and the fact that GORGEOUS LEGEND was able to improve its position to be racing inside FINE ROCK, FINE ROCK was then left racing in a three wide position without cover near the 900 Metres.  He said as the tempo of the race was quite slow, he then rode his mount along after the 800 Metres to see whether FINE ROCK could improve its position forward of BEST HOPE.  He said however that BEST HOPE improved with FINE ROCK and this resulted in FINE ROCK continuing to travel three wide and without cover.  He further stated that after the 600 Metres FINE ROCK again got its head on the side, lay out and made the Home Turn awkwardly.  D Whyte was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, in the opinion of the Stewards, whilst it was evident that his mount was laying out, he should have made more of an effort to improve his position after AZTEC EMPIRE crossed BEST HOPE in an endeavour to prevent that horse from shifting out. 
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HOUSE OF FUN, J Moreira stated that in the early stages he attempted to obtain a position with cover behind FINE ROCK.  He said he was not able to shift across behind that horse in the early stages due to GORGEOUS LEGEND maintaining its position to the inside of HOUSE OF FUN.  He said the tempo of the race then steadied which meant that HOUSE OF FUN was initially left racing in three wide position without cover.  He said during this time HOUSE OF FUN travelled keenly and would not relax.  He said when FINE ROCK was taken into a position three wide without cover, he was able to obtain cover behind that horse after initially being awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse near the 800 Metres due to HOUSE OF FUN continuing to travel keenly.  He added after he was able to settle into a trailing position behind FINE ROCK, the horse settled better, however, he was not able to improve his position when FINE ROCK attempted to go forward of BEST HOPE as HOUSE OF FUN was not travelling as strongly as he had hoped.  He said in the Straight HOUSE OF FUN was then disappointing in that it finished off the race one-paced.  He said, in his opinion, the manner in which HOUSE OF FUN travelled keenly in the early stages when racing without cover was the principal reason for the horse's disappointing performance.  A veterinary inspection of HOUSE OF FUN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Apprentice K K Chiong (SUPREME PROFIT) was spoken to regarding the tempo of the race between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres after obtaining the lead.  Apprentice Chiong was told to be mindful of the tempo she sets so as to ensure that horses are able to finish off their race.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he was asked not to rush LUCKY GIRL early but to allow the horse to stride forward gradually in the early stages to obtain a prominent position.  He said in the early stages LUCKY GIRL was able to improve without having to be ridden along and after entering the Back Straight was able to obtain a position outside MCQUEEN which raced behind the leader SUPREME PROFIT.  He said LUCKY GIRL travelled strongly in the middle stages and he expected the horse to finish off the race well, however, LUCKY GIRL came under pressure after the 600 Metres and, despite being ridden along, did not quicken at any time and in the Straight gave ground.  He added he could not detect any abnormalities with the action of LUCKY GIRL which may have explained the horseâs disappointing run.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of LUCKY GIRL, said as the horse had done particularly well since its last start, he expected it to run well.  He said after M L Yeung rode LUCKY GIRL in a gallop in the lead up to todayâs race, both he and Jockey Yeung considered the horse to be a strong chance as it had worked particularly well.  He said although up in grade today, he did feel that LUCKY GIRL would benefit from having a light weight, so he was not concerned with the step up in class.  He added he was disappointed with the manner in which LUCKY GIRL finished off the race, particularly given the way the horse weakened over the final 200 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of LUCKY GIRL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of LUCKY GIRL was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LUCKY GIRL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to obtain cover on VOLITATION if possible, however, due to the circumstances of the race in the early stages he was required to clear THUNDER DASH to his inside so as not to race unnecessarily wide which resulted in VOLITATION having to race without cover for the majority of the race.

When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he had been asked to ride STARTLING POWER in a forward position and lead if possible.  He said however as it was felt that BORNTOACHIEVE, which was drawn inside STARTLING POWER, would also be ridden to lead and if he was not able to lead, he should sit outside and behind that horse and not to engage in a speed battle.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode STARTLING POWER vigorously in the early stage, however, BORNTOACHIEVE was able to maintain its position to the inside of STARTLING POWER.  He said when it became apparent to him that he would not be able to cross that horse approaching the 1000 Metres, he commenced to steady STARTLING POWER in order to sit about a neck behind BORNTOACHIEVE.  He added STARTLING POWER initially settled well, however, when BRIGHT STRIKE improved its position outside STARTLING POWER near the 700 Metres, STARTLING POWER then commenced to over-race and would not settle and was inclined to get its head up and shift ground which resulted in STARTLING POWER shifting in and bumping BORNTOACHIEVE.

Mr P C Ng, assistant trainer to Mr P O'Sullivan, the trainer of GOOD MAN, and who was not present in Hong Kong tonight, stated that it had initially been intended for the horse to be ridden in a forward position, however, if the horse was not able to lead, then the rider of GOOD MAN should attempt to find cover.  He said however after speaking with the owners of GOOD MAN who felt that the horse had been disappointing in its failure to finish off its races when ridden in a forward position, it was decided for GOOD MAN to be ridden more quietly this evening in the hope that it would be able to finish off the race.  Z Purton, the rider of GOOD MAN, confirmed that as GOOD MAN had not been successful when ridden mostly in forward positions during its racing career in Hong Kong, the owners asked him to ride the horse from off the speed tonight in the hope that it would then be able to close off with more purpose.  He said when being steadied in the early stages GOOD MAN was badly crowded for room, however, this did not affect the horse's position in running to any great degree.  He said although GOOD MAN commenced to race keenly travelling along the Back Straight, it settled better than he anticipated as when ridden behind horses on one occasion previously, GOOD MAN had proved very difficult to settle.  He added GOOD MAN improved its position to be racing between ROCKET LET WIN and MASSIVE POWER at the entrance to the Straight, however, was momentarily crowded for room inside MASSIVE POWER, but at this time GOOD MAN did not give him the feel that it was going to finish off the race strongly, but rather it was going to close off more one-paced.

As the Stewards were of the view that BORN IN CHINA had not properly established running between TURF SPRINT and FREDERICK ENGELS, and given that TURF SPRINT then shifted out marginally away from LUCKY YEAR, they did not take the matter any further despite the incident being one of some significance other than to advise Apprentice Chiong to make every endeavour to keep her mounts on a straight course.
